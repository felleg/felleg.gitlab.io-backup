I think board games are an incredibly powerful tool to develop one's logical abilities. My favorite board
games are the ones that rely on your decision making skills and your ability to trace a path between your
current situation and victory. If a game has easy rules to follow and a quick setup from which emerge complex
and non-obvious mechanics, you know it's probably my jam.

Before the COVID pandemic, one of my favorite activities was to meet with friends and organize board game
jams. Usually 6 to 8 people, two bottles of wine, and many games to discover. Unfortunately, all of this had
to stop, which rendered many games in my collection simply unplayable. Luckily, from this sad reality emerged
the opportunity of re-discovering some games I had neglected in the past.

Specifically, in this post, I will share you 5 games that saw little play from me before being quarantined,
but now stand proudly in the spotlight. Who knows, maybe your new favorite game is among these!

# Splendor

{{< figure src="/img/boardgames/splendor_box.png" position="center" caption="([source](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/2026890/splendor))" >}}

- 2-4 players (My recommandation: 2)
- Playing time: 30 mins
- Age: 10+
- Complexity: Low
- Strategy: Medium

My partner and I like to play this game at dinnertime. It's a game market manipulation that blends a nice mix
of light strategy and luck. One reason why it's (by far) our most-played game is due to how quick it is to
setup, play, and cleanup. Each game easily falls under 30 minutes.

We keep scores on the inside of the box (blasphemous, I know!).

We sit side by side and look at the "board" like a market laying in front of us. There is no feeling of
confrontation, since we are staring at the market instead of taunting each other.

When I was beginning to browse through the list of recommended board games on BoardGameGeek.com, two games
were often mentioned together when it came to market manipulation for two players: Splendor, and Jaipur. If
you are undecided between both games, from my experience Jaipur feels more like a kid's game than Splendor.
The design sensibilities of Splendor feel more fresh after repeated games, in my opinion.

# Patchwork

- 2 players only
- Playing time: 30 minutes
- Age: 8+
- Complexity: Low
- Strategy: Medium

The game mixes the market manipulation of Splendor with the geometrical aspect of Tetris. It has quick setup
and cleanup, game lasts under 30 minutes.

# Scattergories

- 2-6 players
- Playing time: 30 minutes
- Age: 12+
- Complexity: Minimal
- Strategy: Minimal

{{< figure src="/img/boardgames/scattergories_logo.png" position="center" caption="([source](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/4994410/scattergories))" >}}

My favorite way to play Scattergories with friends is using videoconference apps like Zoom to share the
dashboard with everyone at the same time:

This unlicensed version was programmed by Anthony Kenzo Salazar, a freelance designer and developer based in
New York and Los Angeles. It works wonderfully, though is only in English by default and does not support
custom lists at the moment.
