Bananagrams is a word game that can be quickly summarized as "Real-time
Scrabble without a board or points". Its 144 letter tiles come in a
banana-shaped pouch that looks adorable. The official way to play
Bananagrams is simple enough ([click here for the official
rules](/img/bananagrams-how-to-play.jpg)). However, what I would like to
discuss in this post is a variant I discovered by accident that I simply
like to call: Collaborative Bananagrams. Here is a 40 seconds video
demonstration of the game being played:

# Rules of Collaborative Bananagrams

**Collaborative Bananagrams** is very similar to Banana Solitaire, one of
the [four official variants included in the Bananagrams
rules](https://bananagrams.com/blogs/news/how-to-play-bananagrams-instructions-for-getting-started). Here are the adapted rules:

1. Unzip the Banana bag, grab a handful of tiles (~21) and place them
   face-up on the table.
1. Use all the tiles to make a crossword. I call this the **core**
   ([example](/img/banana-core.jpg)).
1. Pass the Banana bag to the person on your left.
1. The person draws 1 tile
   and tries to make it fit in the crossword. They may rearrange
   any part of the crossword as they see fit. Note:
   - They may ask for help.  They may also ask for people *not* to help.

1. When the player placed a tile
   successfully, they pass the bag to the person on their left. And so
   on.

**The goal of the game is to empty the Banana bag within a pre-defined
   amount of time. In my experience, 1 hour is a good initial target.**

Here are some additional twists I like to add in this variant to the usual Bananagrams
rules:

- All languages are accepted, as long as you don't use the internet for
  word suggestions. Notes:
  - you may use the internet to verify someone else's word
  - you are not allowed to use abbreviations, acronyms or proper nouns
- You are allowed to draw a tile from the Banana bag before it reaches
  you so you can think about your next move (I call that a "buffered
  move"). You cannot play out of turn by default, but you can be
  flexible depending on the mood of who you're currently playing with.
- A player may choose to skip their turn at any time.
- When someone spots a mistake on the board, it becomes everyone's top priority
  to solve this error before normal play resumes.
- Outsiders who watch the game without playing ("the board") are the ultimate judges to determine if a word is legal or not. They can voice their opinion about the state of the game at any time and the players must address their feedback.

And don't forget:

- **All tiles on the crossword must be connected.** You cannot have two
  independent crosswords on the table at any point.

# Why I care about Collaborative Bananagrams

As I have said earlier in this post, I discovered Collaborative
Banagrams by accident. We had had the Bananagrams game in the office for
some time, and when I had players to play with, we played it the
official way. Unfortunately for me, there wasn't anyone interested in
playing most of the time. The fact that Bananagrams is by default a
competitive game also seemed to rub people the wrong way ("Why would I
play when I already know I will lose?")

I started playing Banana Solitaire to pass the time at lunchtime, and *that* seemed
to get people's attention. Slowly but surely, day by day, people would
look at me and make comments, asking what game I was playing. I told
them the truth: "I'm playing a crossword game, the goal is to finish the
bag as fast as possible." At that point, I was already playing it in
bilingual mode, simply because that made it more fun for me.

Little by little, people started to join in. Someone dared to use a
Spanish word, so I made the rules even more inclusive: use any language
you know. Soon came the first Italian word, then the first Greek, the first Mandarin, the
first Latin. The flood gates were open!

For weeks, every day I was at the office, I would rush to the cafeteria
at lunch to prepare the core using a handful of tiles and wait for someone
(anyone!) to jump in. I learned that people are more likely to jump in
if you play by yourself for a while instead of asking them to make a
move right away. It seems to make them feel more at ease when they can
see the game in action and see what it's about. I would also post
pictures on Slack (in our `#office` channel) to thank anyone who took
the time to participate me, along with the picture of our game. This was
great at creating memories and visibility:

After two months, we finally got our first win! :grin:

{{< figure src="/img/bananagrams-collab-finished.jpg" position="center" caption="We did it, within 54 minutes! 2023-05-16" >}}

It was incredible! We high-fived each other all around the table. People
were cheering. We were genuinely psyched to have finally done it.
Through teamwork, practice, and with determination, we pulled of what we
initially thought was impossible.

My next highlight came the following week when I opened Slack while I
was working from home and realized people played a game of Collaborative
Bananagrams by themselves, pictures and all! Someone took it upon
themselves to start a game, and they pulled it off. It was a great day
for me.

From this point on, I saw that Collaborative Bananagrams could be more
than a game. For me, it is a tool that has the potential to rewire
relationships at the office. During gameplay, I like use every opportunity I can to high five
someone and make them feel valued. I see it in people's eyes: they
derive meaning from pulling of a complex move in front of everyone and
getting rewarded for it.

So there you have it: Collaborative Bananagrams! Feel free to try this
concept at home or at your workplace and let me know what you think! I
am still in the process of discovering the many ways Collaborative
Bananagrams can be used to foster positive, fearless relationships in
my current workplace, but I must say so far that I am quite happy with the
initial results. :smiley:
