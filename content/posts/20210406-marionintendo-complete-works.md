I recently noticed that I never shared my contributions to rhythm-gaming on this blog. Granted, they are not
the biggest in the world, but they were done over a period that lasted almost a third of my life up to that
point. It's a huge part of who I am and who I used to be, and I figured there was the off-chance that one of
my readers would enjoy discovering this aspect of my past life.

That was back when I was part of a vibrant community and was able to push my creativity on a daily basis.
While the game doesn't suit me now (my "gamer hands" are starting to hurt more quickly than ever in long play
sessions), I am nostalgic about all the great interactions I was able to have through the game.

Here is what I have to say when I originally released this archive:

> I have been creating charts for StepMania and FlashFlashRevolution for over 11 years. This body of work has
> brought me so much more than internet bragging rights. It has brought me closer to the FFR community, from
> which I made many acquaintances. Some of these acquaintances blossomed into amazing friendships. By playing
> these songs today, I am reminded of 11 years spent playing the game I love the most with this community. I am
> reminded of the laughs, the drama, good times and bad times. Mostly good times. :) I am reminded how much I

> Funny to think that every step of the way, I was already feeling all grown up. It goes to show that we never
> stop growing. It makes me hopeful for the future. It makes me smile because I'm sure whatever I do today,
> surely I'll end up doing myself that makes my future self cringe.

> It's kind of funny how I'm still not sure how to view my body of work. It's not perfect. I am far from the
> best at the hobby I chose. And I did not always take the smartest approach at doing things. I am honestly
> impressed by the constant quality of charts released by fellow steppers in the past years. Sometimes I
> remember my accomplishments with rose-tinted glasses; while I reached several personal milestones, I
> never was a groundbreaking stepartist.

> However, this IS my work, and just its existence is meaningful to me. I poured my heart and soul into the
> making of every song listed here (well, almost every song). Hours, days, weeks, months were spent trying to
> refine charts for strangers and myself to experience. As silly as it may sound, to me this pack fully
> documents one of the dimensions in my life. I am eternally grateful to still have these songs after all this
> time, and I hope you will enjoy playing them.
>
> I do not know what this collection of files will mean to you. I leave this here as my legacy. I hope I'm
> not sounding too pretentious, really I'm just moved by the passing of time. If you want to make my day, let's
> have a chat to reminisce about the past and how far we've come!
>
> Join me in celebration, and enjoy the pack!
