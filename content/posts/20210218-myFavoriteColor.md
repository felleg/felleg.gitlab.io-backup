I am starting to understand that in this world, you have to be sincere to be reach others that do not
understand you. Opening up is hard, it makes us vulnerable. To not be noticed or understood is one of my
deepest fears, so I don't want to stand out and become misunderstood. However, in order to be understood by a
crowd that is not listening to your message, you have to grab their attention. So you have to be noticed.

I guess I'm just afraid to look like a fool.

I don't remember what was the first question someone asked me in my life. However, if I allow myself to search
really deep in my mind, the furthest I can go is "what's your favorite color?". A little girl, or a boy, in
kindergarten, curious about me for whatever reason.

And my answer surprised everyone. Every time.

"Yellow".

'How can you prefer yellow above all ther other colors?', would ask the friend. 'Boys like blue, girls like
pink, and both are allowed to like red without being cut from their group', implying no boy or girl likes
yellow, which leaves me to not be human.

When you look at this (admittedly anectodal) [social study of humanity's favorite
color](https://www.livescience.com/34105-favorite-colors.html), you can clearly see that I'm
pretty much all alone in my camp. My favorite color is, on average, the most disliked by both genders.
Incidentally, most of my hobbies have endured the same fate in real life!

That seemed to follow my narrative a bit too well, so here's another random one I found:

This one makes yellow look a little more popular than the first results shown above. However, if you filter
these results only to include colors from the rainbow, yellow is still found at the bottom of the pile. It
still feels bad, and in the back of my mind, I know it's even worse because brown is also part of my favorite colors

I think I remember the first few times I revealed to someone that my favorite color was yellow. Every time I
was met with the same confused reaction, something that felt like the person was saying "What? How can you
like yellow? What good thing in this world is yellow? Yellow is the color of urine, don't you know?"

Well, I do know. Thank you very much. My urine is yellow too. That doesn't mean I admire the inside of the
toilet when I'm done. I don't particularly enjoy staring at urine. I just like the color yellow. I like it on
school buses, I like it on warning signs, I like it on bananas, I like it on lemons, I like it on pop art. It's just
the color that first grabs my eye's attention anywhere I look, almost as if my brain is constantly looking for
it. I can't do anything about it. If I could have a yellow cake for my birthday, that's the color I'd choose.
Yellow is *fun*. Yellow says to everyone: **it's ok to look!** Yellow is butter. Yellow is potato chips out of
the oven. Yellow is toasts grilled to perfection. Yellow is gold.

When I was young, I wanted to fit in and to be accepted. I wanted to be normal. As an adult, I still have that
fear. I want to fit in the crowd. I want to have meaningful, reciprocal interactions with my peers.

These days, however, I am starting to realize that it's ok to be different. It's not better or worse for any
of you, and it won't change my amount of wealth. It just makes a weirdo's life lighter and allow them to focus
their energy on challenges that really matter to them.

We cannot all be normal, because society would not work. We would have a surplus of people with the same
talents, same fears, same preferences, same weaknesses. Weirdos would have power because they would be able to
do unbelievably rare things.

I used to want to be part of the 90 %. Now, I want to feel what it's like to be part of the remaining 10%. I
shouldn't be scared of being different, it's literally baked into my end goal.

All this time, I lied to myself in order to please others.

At first, I just flat out pretended that blue was my favorite color. "If you can't beat 'em, 'join 'em!". But
even myself wouldn't buy such an obvious lie. To my eyes, blue is one of the most passive colors of the
rainbow.

Then, I switched gear. I went for my second favorite color, brown. I figured it was still part of my top, so
I'd still somewhat respect myself. But people were almost even more bewildered than when I told them my
favorite color was yellow. Your favorite color can be anything, even black and white, but brown is almost an
alien choice. Almost as if brown is less of a color than black and white.

Finally, I settled on the green for my lie. It was halfway between yellow and blue, and was still prominently
part of the rainbow. And, for once, people accepted the answer most of the time.

You know what? There were times when I'd slip in that my favorite colors were green and brown - like the
colors of a tree! People seemed to accept that approach. I guess they forgot that they are surrounded
by brown stuff all the time. But never again did I slip on yellow being my favorite color.

(I just realized the my top 3 colors were the primary colors found on a banana. What does that mean about me?)

Well, I'm able to say it now. Yellow is and will always be my favorite color. If I have told you anything else
in the past, I was lying to your face (sorry). Out of respect for my favorite color, I am making this blog
post to make up for lost time.

There is a silver lining, though. I have just realized that, after all these blog posts, the only color
featured in my logo and website icon is orange-yellow:

"What's your favorite color" is a line people jokingly say when they want to amusingly pretend like they want
to get to know you. But I think it's an interesting question because it asks a person to give their opinion on
a subject that does not matter, that shouldn't have any concrete consequence in this world. Is answerer going
to be truthful? How many layers will their answer have? Are they the type of person that lies to themself to
make it easier to lie to others?
