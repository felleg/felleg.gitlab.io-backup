üëç - This is a poetic management book that looks a how nature self-organizes and how we can use this force in our organizations. It is a nice blend of highly metaphysical and strangely actionable ideas. I'm sure it took courage to publish a book like this. It made me think a lot about the game of Go and the book _Reinventing Organizations_ (#37).

Read [the notes I took](/books/a-simpler-way.pdf) from this book.
