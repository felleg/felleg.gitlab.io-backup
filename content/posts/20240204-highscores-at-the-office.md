# "I want to improve."

To me, there four words are very special. I believe the first time someone says
these words to themselves, they have already begun changing for the
better.

I did not always want to improve. Ten years ago, I was perfectly content
with the thought of being myself for the rest of my life, despite
whatever flaws I had. Or so I thought. The point is, I wasn't truly
interested in personal improvement.

I wore whatever. I listened to whatever. My hair was crazy. I wasn't
working out -- I didn't see a reason to. In fact, I wasn't working,
period.

It's funny how, looking back, I rarely worked. I remember somes jobs
where work felt like work, and it was clearly work. Some other jobs,
though, I was just looking for ways *not* to have to do the work that
was asked of me.

I was the worst kind of lazy. I rested on my natural skills and got fat
on them, so much so that I had to learn the painful truth that if you
don't work at getting better, change in your life has a higher chance of
being negative.

# Games games games

The only thing that ever sustainably caught my attention has
been games.  If I can't gamify something, I tend to
immediately lose interest. This is a useful skill in making
work fun. It becomes a high bar when you're depressed and
see your creativity decline.

As a result of not knowing what else to do, I have spent a
huge chunk of my life hooked on video games. Not just any
kind of games; retro video games, i.e. video games released
20 years or more before the time you're playing them. In
fact, I
doubt you could find an arcade game from the 1990s that I
haven't at least seen in motion before. Note: I'm not
particularly proud of that :sweat_smile:

As a teen going into adulthood, I spent glorious evenings
discovering about DoDonPachi, Radiant Silvergun, Einh√§nder,
and other niche titles. My poor parents probably had no idea
what to think about that! It reached a point where I
assembled such a big collection of games, it took me over a year
of active effort to manage to sell it all -- I've event got
the [blog post](/selling-collection) to prove it!

For many years, I felt like an addict who was wasting their
lives down the drain to get an increasingly inaccessible hit
of dopamine. I assembled a temple of incredible video-gaming
experiences in my mind, but what for? I was picturing myself
as alone in a
room with no one to share those memories with. That's a
pretty depressing thought, if you ask me.

Fortunately, that didn't stop me from trying to figure out
how to make sense of life. I had accumulated a [huge curated catalog
of unique retro experiences](/games) that I was enjoying
almost every day. And here's the kicker: I never expected
this catalog to ever get some use... Until 3 months ago.

# We have an arcade? Here?

When I started working at Portage Montreal (please let me
use this name! :pray:), I found a little coffeetable in the
rec room that served little to no use. My immediate thought
when I saw it was, "I could put an arcade setup there!" In
the past, I had brought my MiSTer FPGA to the office, but
there was no way to leave a permanent setup ("Gaming in an
office? During work hours? Preposterous!"). This was now my
chance to create and operate my own setup and just... see
how it evolves with the organization's culture.

After some months of experimenting, I finally ended up with
this setup:


{{< figure src="/img/arcade-notarius.JPG" position="center" caption="The humble arcade setup, using a [MiSTer FPGA](/mister)" >}}

What's pictured here is:

- An LCD screen that can be rotated into portrait mode
- A [MiSTer FPGA](/mister)
- A [custom Qanba Carbon arcade stick](/qanba-carbon)

Few people can appreciate what this modest setup is actually
doing. For example, when you play your game of Tetris the
Grand Master on this exact setup, it is as close as anyone
on planet Earth can currently get to actually experiencing
how this game *felt* when it was released exclusively in the
arcade centers of Japan in the 1990s. And, quite honestly,
that's not even the point, I just felt like this was a neat
thing to say in passing.

What I love most about the arcades is that they can be used
as an inception tool for the idea "I want to improve." They
almost robotically inject this idea into our minds, with the
following mechanisms:

1. By being better, you get to enjoy a longer and more
   interesting game, which requires you improving.
1. By taking note of your score at the end, you can
   quantifiably measure yourself against an older version of
   yourself. Naturally, this will give you an incentive to
   improve.
1. By comparing your score to your colleagues', you will be
   tempted to beat the score of other people so you can feel
   a bit better about yourself. This, also, pushes someone
   to improve.

Arcade games are pointless and dumb by themselves.
Physically, they are at best good for your reflexes, and at
worst bad for your eyes and stress level. Yet, I can't help
but think that there's something more to this type of social
gaming. Something that is a lot more aligned with modern-day
management best practices as one might be led to believe.

# I'll teach you how to make the magician appear

Tell about how you have to learn about everything when
starting to play this game, even getting a coin in. Either
you learn by yourself, either you learn to ask for help,
either someone learns to coach you

Tell the story of how Christian and I bonded when he taught
me how to make the magician appear in ghosts 'n goblins
(tell that it's a notorious game for being hard and cryptic)

I'm looking forward to the day where the team, after a few
rounds of Mortal Kombat 3, start saying these words:
