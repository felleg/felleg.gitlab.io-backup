# "I can improve."

To me, there words are very special. They are a symptom of a growth
mindset. They are very different from saying "I want to improve."

I did not always believe those words. Ten years ago, I was perfectly content
with the thought of being "myself" for the rest of my life, despite
whatever flaws I had. I wasn't interested in personal improvement
because, at a deep level, I didn't believe that I could truly push
myself to new levels of performance.

I wanted to improve. I hoped it would happen. But I wasn't ready to work
for it.

For most of my life, I rested on my natural skills and got fat
on them, so much so that I had to *learn* the painful truth that if you
don't work at getting better, change in your life has a higher chance of
being negative.

# Grand Master

The only thing that ever sustainably caught my attention has
been games.

I have spent a
huge chunk of my life hooked on video games, mostly old ones. As a teen
going into adulthood, I spent glorious evenings discovering about
DoDonPachi, Radiant Silvergun, Einh√§nder, and other niche titles. My
poor parents probably had no idea what to think about that. It reached a
point where I assembled such a big collection of games, it took me over
a year of active effort to manage to sell it all -- I've event got the
[blog post](/selling-collection) to prove it!

One game in particular changed everything: [Tetris the Grand
Master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris:_The_Grand_Master). I
could write an entire blog post about this specific version of Tetris
(and probably will one day!), but for now I'll just say that, thanks to
its grading system, TGM managed to make my pursuit of "getting better"
meaningful. The more I played, the more my brain recognized patterns
and allowed me to reach heights I never thought possible.

In short, I have to give my thanks to the creator of Tetris the Grand
Master, Ichiro Mihara, for planting in me the seeds of the growth
mindset. For an entire year, I focused all of my gaming efforts on
achieving a Grand Master rank at Tetris. Though I did not succeed, I
could truly feel for the first time that the journey was indeed of
greater importance than the destination.

Eventually, it dawned on me that Tetris the Grand Master, as polished as
it was, was not a unique experience. Literally thousands of games are
built on the same philosophy: short experiences that increase in
difficulty over time, until you run out. All of these games grade you at
the end, usually in the form of score. Getting the highscore is similar
to becoming a Grand Master.

This is the realm of arcade games.

# How arcades work

The "arcade" as a genre of games was born in 1978 with [Space
Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders). The premise is
simple: you insert a coin and start the game with a set amount of lives
(usually three). You rack up points until you run out of lives. You note
your score at the end of the game. With every new game, you try to beat
your previous score.

In 2024, arcade games look quaint. They are not as flashy
as modern releases, they are not lengthy, and are probably bad for your
blood pressure. However, to understand where the magic of arcade games
lie, you have to remember the rooms in which they used to live.

{{< figure src="/img/center-computing-history.jpg" position="center" caption="A crowd at the Centre for Computing History's arcade" >}}

When arcade games were in their prime, they were social environments
first, gaming environments second. The magic of the arcade is how it
manages to bring people together and align them towards a common
objective: learning how to play the game.

When playing an arcade alone, one can motivate themselves to improve
their own score. However, that usually doesn't last long. Have five or
more people play the game, though, and you will see something
interesting happen: Alice will beat Bob's score, which will prompt Bob
to attempt beating Alice's score. In the background, Cory is noticing
that everyone's score went way up, so he asks them how they did it. They
coach him. Everyone helps each other to improve.

Alice and Bob might be the masters of game X, but Cory might be the
master of game Y. Such things are totally unpredictable!

The point is that arcade games as a genre, unlike most other gaming
genres, pushes everyone involved gently in the direction of teaming up
in order to achieve new heights. The fact that most of them are
genuinely interesting in their design and construction is just icing on
the cake!

**What I love most about the arcades is that they can be used
as an inception tool for the idea "I can improve."** They
almost robotically inject this idea into our minds, with the
following mechanisms:

1. By being better, you get to enjoy a longer and more
   interesting game, which requires you improving.
1. By taking note of your score at the end, you can
   quantifiably measure your performance against an older version of
   yourself. Naturally, this will give you an incentive to
   improve.
1. By comparing your score to your colleagues', you will be
   tempted to beat the score of other people so you can feel
   a bit better about yourself. This, also, pushes someone
   to improve.

Arcade games are pointless and dumb by themselves.
Physically, they are at best good for your reflexes, and at
worst bad for your eyes and stress level. Yet, I can't help
but think that there's something more to this type of social
gaming. Something that is a lot more aligned with modern-day
management best practices as one might be led to believe.

# We have an arcade? Here?

When I started working at [Portage Cybertech](https://portagecybertech.com), I found a little coffeetable in the
rec room that served little to no use. My immediate thought
when I saw it was, "I could put an arcade setup there!" In
previous jobs, I had brought my gaming gear to the office, but
there was no way to leave a permanent setup ("Gaming in an
office? During work hours? Preposterous!"). This was now my
chance to create and operate my own setup and just... see
how it evolves with the organization's culture.

After some months of experimenting, I finally ended up with
this setup:


{{< figure src="/img/arcade-notarius.JPG" position="center" caption="The humble arcade setup, using a [MiSTer FPGA](/mister), of course!" >}}

What's pictured here is:

- An LCD screen that can be rotated into portrait mode
- A [MiSTer FPGA](/mister)
- A [custom Qanba Carbon arcade stick](/qanba-carbon)

Few people can appreciate what this modest setup is actually
doing. For example, when you play your game of Tetris the
Grand Master on this exact setup, it is as close as anyone
on planet Earth can currently get to actually experiencing
how this game *felt* when it was released exclusively in the
arcade centers of Japan in the 1990s. And, quite honestly,
that's not even the point, I just felt like this was a neat
thing to say in passing. :smiley:


# There's always a trick

Tell about how you have to learn about everything when
starting to play this game, even getting a coin in. Either
you learn by yourself, either you learn to ask for help,
either someone learns to coach you

Tell the story of how Christian and I bonded when he taught
me how to make the magician appear in ghosts 'n goblins
(tell that it's a notorious game for being hard and cryptic)

I'm looking forward to the day where the team, after a few
rounds of Mortal Kombat 3, start saying these words:
