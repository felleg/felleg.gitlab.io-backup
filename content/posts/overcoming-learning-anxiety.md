# Preface

> *Awareness of wrongdoing is the starting point of healing, for he who
> does not know that he is doing wrong does not wish to be set right.*
> 
> Lucius Annaeus Seneca, *Letters on Ethics*

I wrote this book because I wanted to educate people about learning
anxiety. In this day and age, we don't hear many people talk about
this subject, and I believe therein lies the issue. Mental healing
requires acknowledgement, and acknowledgement requires knowledge of
the problem. The anxious learner is less likely to learn about their
condition, because the idea of learning feels unsafe to them in the
first place. It is a sadly ironic predicament.

In traversing the 2020 COVID-19 epidemic, I believe we have all
learned something about importance of mental health. I have observed
growing acceptance in public discourse for using therapy as a way to
heal, which personally makes me quite happy as a believer in such
treatments. Society has made great
progress in beginning to accept how serious anxiety disorders are for
the individual. However, I have yet to hear someone say anything about
learning anxiety in the real world, let alone have them come forward
to talk about how they were affected by this disease, how they worked
through it, and how healing transformed their lives.

"Be the change I want to
see in the world" is what motivated me to write this book. I
surely don't know enough about the science of neurology to claim
expertise on the topic of learning anxiety. However, I did have severe
learning anxiety, and I feel the need to bring awareness to this
condition while the experience is
still fresh in my mind. Overcoming learning anxiety is the most
gratifying thing I have ever experienced. It changed my life.
By rediscovering joy in learning and
in creating my own system of learning, I have found the key to
unlimited mountains of wisdom that profoundly impacted every aspect of
my identity. Where I once felt stuck in constantly repeating the same
mistakes, I could now read a book on the subject that enlarged my
perspective, made me see things differently, and suggested different
ways to act. 

As I write these lines, there is a single lingering fear in me: am I preaching to the
choir? What are the
chances that people afraid of reading books make the decision to read
this one? However slim those odds are, I have to take them, if only as
a token of gratitude for the authors that changed my
life with their words.

I wish all anxious learners would know that they are *not
broken*. They simply lost something: joy in learning. It can be
rediscovered. In fact, restoring your joy in learning might be the
most meaningful experience of your life. It certainly has been for me
so far. This process doesn't even need to take very long to have a big
impact. What we will attempt together in this book is changing how
you approach information, so that it makes you feel powerful instead
of anxious.

<!--
I have suffered from learning anxiety for the majority of my life and
I was oblivious to it. Being anxious about learning made me afraid of
failure, which in turn hindered my natural development. It didn't
matter what accolades I had on my CV. It was all luck. The truth is, I
was afraid to fail, and I had forgotten what learning felt like. My
life had no meaning. I was miserable at work. It was only when I was confronted
with the risk of losing it all that I found in me the will to learn
*how to learn*.  Without exaggeration, this experience of overcoming
my learning anxiety gave me a second chance at life. Not only did it
reconnect me with my brain, it made me aware of different, better ways
to live. By reading, I could learn from other people's mistakes and
save myself unthinkable amounts of time. It has made me at peace, both
with myself and with the world around me. Thus, I believe it is my
duty to share my story and what I *learned* from it, in the hope that
this text reaches someone in need -- you, perhaps?
-->

True learning, the kind that changes the decisions we make, the
actions we take, and the course of our lives, is almost universally
painful to traverse. Each bruise is a stepping stone, a bump in the
road that stands in the way of fulfilling our potential and our true
desires. It is what it is. If only we can learn to trust the process,
we will notice that we can attain everything we hope for and more. All
it requires is the willingness to fail, to learn, to succeed. We can
learn to love learning.

Now more than ever, the information is out there. It has been
available for generations
and generations. Some of the most valuable lessons humanity has
learned was written over 2,000 years ago by Greek philosophers.
However, if we don't feel confident in our ability to
navigate it all, it is as if that information didn't exist. All
that wisdom stays imprisoned in its ink. The gift of humanity is
wasted on us.

If there's only one thing I'd want you to remember from all of this,
it's that **anyone can experience learning anxiety and solving it
requires a system of your own creation that will make learning a
joyful experience to you**.

In this text, I will tell you my story:
how I discovered I had learning anxiety, the impact it had on my life,
and the techniques I developed to work through it. If you experience
learning anxiety, my hope is that this text will make you realize that
you are not alone and that there is a way out. You can overcome any
obstacle that stands in your way, and you can even have fun while
doing it. You might rediscover yourself and the world around you like
you never have before. All it takes is the willingness to fail and learn from our
mistakes. And, perhaps, the urge to read a book or two. Or {{< n_books
>}}.

I sincerely hope this text will bring value to your life.

# Introduction: Discovering I had learning anxiety

> *There are two kinds of anxiety associated with learning: “learning
> anxiety” and “survival anxiety.” Learning anxiety comes from being
> afraid to try something new for fear that it will be too difficult,
> that we will look stupid in the attempt, or that we will have to
> part from old habits that have worked for us in the past. **Learning
> something new can cast us as the deviant in the groups we belong
> to.** It can threaten our self-esteem and, in extreme cases, even
> our identity.*
>
> *You can’t talk people out of their learning anxieties; they’re the
> basis for resistance to change. And given the intensity of those
> fears, none of us would ever try something new unless we experienced
> the second form of anxiety, survival anxiety—the horrible
> realization that in order to make it, you’re going to have to
> change. Like prisoners of war, potential learners experience so much
> hopelessness through survival anxiety that eventually they become
> open to the possibility of learning. But even this dejection is not
> necessarily enough. Individuals can remain in a state of despair
> permanently.*
>
> *How can leaders help their followers maximize their learning while
> minimizing their pain?*
>
> (Edgar H. Schein, [The Anxiety of
Learning](https://hbr.org/2002/03/the-anxiety-of-learning))

I wasn't always aware of how bad my learning anxiety was, and I'm
convinced that most people who suffer that condition don't realize it
either.

In my younger years, to the outsider, I must have looked like a virtuoso in everything I
touched. I could improvise on the piano with sensitivity at age 9
after a single year of home classes. I intuitively understood
Mathematics from a young age up to well into my college years. Words
flowed naturally through me when I was writing, both in French and in
English. I could juggle and ride kilometers on a unicycle. [And you should
have seen me play with a flower
stick](https://youtu.be/i8HtXcQfBOM?si=Cdq56ZEE0RJ1uma0)! I had a
quick mind, piercing eyes and a sharp sense of
humor. I could dominate anyone at any (video) game I picked up. I was
never the strongest boy, but my charm and my wits were such that if I
decided to get something done, no matter how difficult, I would always
find a way.  And, as surprising as this may sound, I was still popular at
school. I had more friends than most. My teachers loved me. My
friends' parents loved me. I was never bullied. To summarize, I had it
all, and it all felt easy.

**Giftedness** refers to an exceptional level of natural ability or talent
in one or more areas, such as intellectual, creative, artistic, or
leadership capacities. It is often recognized in children who show
advanced abilities compared to their peers.

Well. My giftedness turned out to be a curse.

All light creates shadow. When it comes to giftedness, there is one major
downside. When you are used to being good at everything, as soon as you
no longer are for a particular activity, your ego probably won't be able to handle
it, so you often give up too easily. This comes at a price that is worth more
than talent: **lack of grit**.

The trained eye would
have noticed a pattern in me. As soon as I found someone better than
me at something, this didn't inspire me, nor make me curious, nor turn
me into a fan. It made me *give up!* When I felt like I had reached my
depth at something, I lost all interest in pushing forward and
improving. There were many hints of that, in hindsight.

As good as my flower stick abilities were, I snubbed techniques that
were out of my reach by labelling them as "less interesting." I
despised losing at board games that didn't rely on luck. For example,
I stopped playing Chess as soon as I started losing. I lost interest
in karate as soon as I got my first hit in the face. I never started
cooking, because I didn't feel great at it. Learning to ride a
snowboard was one of most challenging things I had ever done as a
child, because I had to continue making attempts to avoid being left
behind despite how bad it
hurt in general.

I smile when I remind myself of all these memories. I had no idea of
the vacuum I was creating in my soul. Life had given me many
abilities, but left me with the impression that new abilities could
not be developed.

Unsolved problems keep building up until they turn into a crisis. This
is where our story begins -- with an existential crisis.

<!--

I
knew I felt bad about my performance at work. I had felt that for a
long time, but I couldn't quite put my finger on why. It's not that I
wasn't trying hard enough: in fact, I felt I was trying so hard that I
was getting close to burning out. However, A series of events eventually put me in survival mode, where I had two
possible outcomes:

- learn to adapt...
- ... or learn to let go.

This led me to read a certain *DevOps Handbook*, which led me to write
down these words:

{{< figure src="/img/learning-anxiety-lightbulb.jpg" position="center" caption="A photo of my notes: ''In the team, we want to help overcome learning anxiety.''" >}}

Well, here it is. This is the moment when my mind clicked and realized
*I* had learning anxiety. Before writing it down and seeing it with my
own eyes for the first time --- "learning anxiety" --- I had never
heard of that concept before. It was completely alien to me. While it
did make logical sense and described accurately how I felt, how could
I claim to have learning anxiety if I had a Masters in Physics?
Clearly, I had above average learning abilities, right? I felt like I
had no excuse to feel the way I was feeling.

But it was true. Regardless of my past achievements, I simply had
plain old learning anxiety.

I certainly knew how I felt when it came to learning: to put it
mildly, I felt my learning performance was below that of all those
around me.

It seems ironic to me that I had to overcome my learning anxiety in
order to learn that this was exactly the problem holding me back. In
other words, precisely as I was writing *"learning anxiety (<- **I
have that!**)"*, I was beginning to heal, although I hadn't realized
it. Very meta...

Let's start untangling this mental knot by going back in time.

# Part 1

## Chapter 1: The anxiety begins

In 2017, fresh out of University and feeling ready to tackle the world, I
started working for a newly-formed startup then-called Proximity HCI
(now known as [Contxtful](https://contxtful.com)). I had just finished
my Masters thesis in particle Physics and was ready to jump into the
world of software development ([this is something I already discussed on my blog in
2019](/posts/2019/10/why-i-shifted-from-physics-to-focus-on-software/)).
I had developed a recent fondness for computers after analyzing
multiple particle trajectories for my thesis.

Machine learning was the hot buzzword at the time and so I was hired as a machine learning scientist, and chipped away at tasks
for many months. Unfortunately, a few months in, things were clearly
not working out. There was no science to my methods. I just cobbled
algorithms together and hoped they would work magically. With machine
learning, I was simply "not on my X", as we say in French, meaning I
wasn't in the right context to fulfill my potential. As I naturally
drifted
towards handling the IT of the company and discovering automated
deployment pipelines, my then-manager (and trusted friend!) Alexandre
Désilets-Benoit said something that would change my life.

*"You know what? I think DevOps would be a good fit for you."*

For  someone with a self-diagnosed impostor syndrome, receiving this
kind of information is a mixed bag. On one hand, it finally explained
why I was  having such a difficult time  accomplishing the tasks I was
given. This  was a relief. *"Of course, it all makes sense now! I'm
bad at machine learning because, deep down, I'm a DevOps!  Yes, change
my title now, please! This will fix all my problems"*, I would say to
myself on my little cloud of joy. On the other hand, I now faced an
undodgeable question: *"What the heck is DevOps, anyway?"*

You can  probably imagine why, depending on the day, my impostor
syndrome simply got out of control. I had started as a humble
Physicist. I had then changed career paths after my Masters degree to
become a Machine Learning scientist (out of nowhere). I had come to
the conclusion that I was even worse at that job, so much so that my
boss recommended another career change into a field I knew absolutely
nothing about. I was rightfully terrified!

Not wanting to waste any time, I feverishly started Googling the most
basic things, like "How to DevOps?" and "What is DevOps?". To give you
an idea of the steepness of the learning curve I was faced with, check
out [this introductory video from TechWorld with
Nina](https://youtu.be/9pZ2xmsSDdo?si=UHPLsU2gar5CNhCZ) and count how
many times something along the lines of "you need to learn / know /
understand" is said:

{{< youtube 9pZ2xmsSDdo >}}

(I counted over 30 occurrences.)

Every search result required me to do at least three other searches to
understand what basic sentences meant. For a while, it felt like I was
surrounded by buzzwords, with no clear explanations in sight. The
rabbit hole just kept on going and going. Oh how I
wished Jimmy Neutron's "[book
gum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1ambhfSnBA)" was real!

This process of drinking from a fire hose of information while
struggling to get anything done lasted *years*, and it was unpleasant.
I felt useless. I felt ashamed. I wished I could go back in time and
learn about agile, CI/CD, and other DevOps requirements during my
studies instead of having filled my brain with equations of motion
that I had no use for. In short, at 27 years old, I already felt like
I had missed the boat, and with each passing day felt more like giving
up.

I deeply felt like I wasn't
accomplishing as much as I should have, considering the amount of
energy I was pouring daily into my work, yet I had no idea what I
could try to find a solution to my problems. From the outside, it might
have looked like this:

{{< figure src="/img/too-busy.jpeg" position="center" caption="''Just get off your bike for a second!''" >}}



The only thing pushing me forward was the fact that my colleagues
depended on my work, as amateurish as it was. I could entertain the
idea of going down in a big ball of fire, but I didn't want my
colleagues to suffer the fall with me. I wanted them to thrive and
excel at their respective tasks. Ironically, I now believe this is
precisely the kind of mindset that drives the DevOps philosophy, to do
everything you can to maximize the value your peers can deliver.
However, I was simply too discouraged at the time to realize this...

In 2019, as I was going on vacation, I stumbled upon a book called
*[The Phoenix Project](/reads/read-41-1-the-phoenix-project/)*, which
seemed really popular in the DevOps space as an entry point into the
subject matter. It was written as a novel, so I thought: "Ah! This is
perfect material to read on the beach, without any pressure to learn.
This should be fun."

{{< figure src="/img/phoenix-project.png" position="center" caption="" >}}

Turns out, it was great fun indeed! There are many reasons for this, I
believe. Firstly, the book is, of course, very well written. It
wouldn't sell over 500,000 copies if it wasn't. I connected with the
story and its cast of characters that reminded me of my daily
interactions with my colleagues. Secondly, and more importantly, the
fact that I was open to the material and didn't feel pressured to
understand everything right away made a big difference. Learning felt
optional, and so my anxiety had no reason to get triggered. Finally,
and this is key, I enjoyed this book because I read it in its
entirety. This is something I will come back to later in this post.

In a single week, I had finished reading my first DevOps book. Woohoo!
I felt like I was ready to conquer the world. My mind was now filled
with ideas I was excited to try out. *The Phoenix Project* subtly
advertised for another book from the same author, *[The DevOps
Handbook](https://amzn.to/4clZUMF)*, which supposedly contained
everything you needed to know to propel your business forward like the
protagonist of *The Phoenix Project* did. I felt ready for it. It was
now my turn to be the main character. Bring it on!


## Chapter 2: *The DevOps Handbook*

I ordered my copy of *[The DevOps Handbook](https://amzn.to/4clZUMF)*
in 2019. I finished it on August 6, 2022. For those keeping count,
that means three years of lead time. What happened?

The [Dunning-Kruger
effect](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)
is what happened. I had reached the peak of Mount Stupid. Some people
call this "premature enlightenment." My confidence in my ability to
learn from reading had risen above my actual abilities.

{{< figure src="/img/dunning-kruger-effect.png" position="center" caption="The path to mastery of any type involves traversing the Dunning-Kruger graph from left to right." >}}

After only a few chapters, I began to feel dizzy. This book wasn't
like the Phoenix Project. It was a _real_ book, one that required
actual effort to read through. It laid the truth bare: I had no idea
what I had gotten myself into. I quickly fell into the Valley of
Despair.

Every new information felt like it took the place of another one in my
head, reminiscent of a musical chair of knowledge.  For example, I had
trouble remembering what the [Three Ways of
DevOps](https://itrevolution.com/articles/the-three-ways-principles-underpinning-devops/)
stood for, even though they were central parts of both the Phoenix
Project and the handbook. It felt like I was drowning in information.
If the Phoenix Project managed to organically sneak in   a reasonable
amount of information within the context  of  the story, the *DevOps
Handbook* proved to be too much for me. There seemed to be no time for
relaxation: The handbook  simply lined the knowledge nuggets one after
the other relentlessly.

Very early on, I could feel my reading velocity diminish as I was
reading my physical copy. I took a stab at the digital version on my
Kobo to see if that could help (I was very big on e-readers at the
time, see [I Love
E-readers](https://felixleger.com/posts/2020/10/i-love-e-readers/)),
but I got the same result; Initial progress was quick, and then
everything ground to a halt.

Reluctantly, I shelved  the handbook both physically and digitally,
feeling ashamed and defeated. I felt even more like an impostor: the
fact I couldn't get through the *DevOps Handbook* proved it. I became
fixated on the notion that I was a fake DevOps.

This pattern of excitement for learning leading  to bitter
disillusionment was, as you might have guessed, not limited to the
*DevOps Handbook*.  Throughout most of my time at Contxtful (almost
five years), I was given the opportunity to learn, and by my own
account, failed to do so more   than I succeeded. I was going from
Mount Stupid to Mount Stupid, never making it through any Valley of
Despair.

Eventually, the feeling of being unable to reach  my full potential at
Contxtful (and potentially hurting the company as a result) led me to
quit my job and join [nesto](https://nesto.ca), in the hope that there
lied the key  that would unlock my potential. And would you believe
it, each member of nesto's DevOps team received their own copy of the
*DevOps Handbook* as a welcome gift. This book was following me
everywhere I went! At this point, so much time had elapsed since I had
started reading it that the second edition of the Handbook had now
come out. I was feeling embarrassed.

Surely there was some secret sauce at nesto that would allow me to
succeed where I failed at Contxtful. What new possibilities would
allow me to escape the dreaded Valley of Despair?

The answer came quickly: for the first time in my life, I was
threatened with termination.

## Chapter 3: Aha!

In June 2022, three months after joining the nesto DevOps team, I
received the unfortunate news: I was getting a probation extension. I
wasn't quite cutting it in the workplace. I had trouble learning the
new tools and processes required to become a productive teammate. New
concepts and important details eluded me. To summarize, I was failing,
and hard. If I didn't manage to course-correct within two months, I
could kiss my new job goodbye.

This is what put me into **survival mode**, where the hopelessness of
the situation was such that it finally made me open to learning. I couldn't bear the thought of being rejected by my newly-elected home. It would have made leaving Contxtful feel like a mistake, and would have left me without a plan B. I *had* to get through that probation period at nesto, no matter what it cost me.

I had never explicitly been told by a manager that I was not pulling my own weight. I wasn't going to waste this opportunity to show the
world what I could do when given proper motivation.  So I got to work,
big time. My focus in mid-June was higher than ever, thanks to
survival instincts that kicked into high gear. One of my first
personal goals was to get through the *DevOps Handbook* before the end
of my extended probation, partly to prove to myself that I could
accomplish something for once.

And then, something magical happened. At page 107, three years after
I had started the book, I found a sentence that hit me like a ton of bricks.

> In the team, we want to help overcome learning anxiety.

For the first time in my life, I saw the demon in me. It was learning
anxiety all along. It was making me afraid of learning, of trying, of
failing. That's what kept wasting my time. That's what kept me in the
Valley of Despair.

I was made plainly aware that if I wanted to learn the necessary
skills that would allow me to keep my job, I would first have to learn
how to beat this learning anxiety out of me. I would have to make
learning things feel *safe*.

But how?

## Chapter 4: Opening Pandora's Box

The hardest part of making a breakthrough is finding the right problem
to solve. I had just identified my problem, *learning anxiety*. You can bet I wanted
revenge for all the precious years it made me waste.

I became much more open to trying new things. I worked overtime to
better understand how some complex programs worked. I recorded video
demonstrations to motivate myself to keep trying things. I celebrated
whatever small successes I could accomplish. It was hard, but I felt I
was going in the right direction.

One evening, our team leader Mathieu Frenette welcomed us into his apartment for a
special occasion. It was a nice bonding experience for all of us. My
latest efforts had made me feel more welcomed in the team. I felt better
about participating in discussions. I will never forget the moment
when Mathieu came back with a stack of books as we were
trying different flavors of spicy chocolate on his patio. There were books of all
kinds, none related to our current job. He was eager to share what he
was learning about.

None of the content on display fascinated me more than the way Mathieu
held those books. It felt wrong, gross, even. Never in my life had I
seen someone hold a book like that. It sent shivers down my spine. It felt like he was breaking an
unwritten rule. Here's what it looked like:

{{< figure src="/img/how-to-fold-a-book.gif" position="center" caption="The book suplex" >}}

I asked Mathieu why he was folding his books this way. He simply
replied with his characteristic grin: "It's so much more comfortable!"

That made me pause. Could this have been my missing ingredient all
along?


## Flashback

---
About 10 years ago, I was a relatively money-poor grad student. I was
somewhat short on cash and keeping my old course textbooks was not
something I could afford to do. Thus, I took great care of these
textbooks, seldom highlighting or writing in them, in order to boost
their eventual sale price.

Unfortunately, this strategy was sub-optimal. For  an extra $40 per
book sold, I was taking the risk of having a lesser learning
experience.  Without realizing it, I always saw my books as someone
else's items that I was borrowing, or some item that might become
desirable in the future, like Pokémon trading cards.  This was so
wrong. As a student, I was depriving myself of potentially useful
learning tools in fear of wasting resources (money). I was like a
boxer who was afraid  to damage his punching bag. Maybe I had this
mindset since I was used to owning collectible items (see [how and why
I got rid of my video game
collection](/posts/2021/03/selling-my-video-game-collection-the-hoarding-project/)).
Whatever the reason, I'm glad I made it this far in  life  despite
this backwards mindset, because I don't plan on doing this ever again.

---

Let's think about punching bags for a moment. If someone was standing
in a gym next to their punching bag, you would probably understand
that whatever damage the bag exhibits went directly into making that
person stronger, punch after punch, and kick after kick. If you had to
fight someone, you'd probably pick the boxer with a seemingly
untouched punching bag in their gym, since this means they probably
haven't practiced boxing at all.

{{< figure src="/img/punching-bags.png" position="center" caption="I don't know about you, but I'd rather spar with the person who practiced with the bag on the left." >}}


The book suplex made something click in my head. It opened Pandora's
box. **Books are punching bags for our brain**. They are meant to be
used however necessary to make you stronger.

Let me get preachy about it. **It's ok to damage your books. That's the point of owning them.** You
are meant to be free to bend them, write in them, fold them, in any
way that allows you to *learn faster*. Rip pages off if you must.
Doodle in them if you must. Your
copy is *yours*. Please don't think of books as decorations; think of
them as food that nourishes your soul! *Use them*. If
you damaged a book to the
point that you believe it to be unusable by anyone else, it is ok to
put it in a recycling bin afterward. Few people realize how invaluable our
ability to learn truly is -- it is well worth a few hundred pages if
it can change your life and the lives of others around you. In
summary, my final advice on the matter is to stop respecting books,
and to start respecting how your brain learns.  :smiley:

You can't imagine how joyful I was to suplex the DevOps Handbook. It
had held me back for so long, I felt like I was getting revenge. It
was such a cathartic experience. Page after page, I was folding it,
compressing it, damaging it, writing in it, and with each day passing, I saw the book
get more and more used by my doing. I hadn't yet learned how to take
notes (we'll get to that in [Chapter
5](#chapter-5-creating-a-system-of-learning)), but I was making more
progress than ever, simply because the act of using my hands to
flatten the book made me feel powerful. The book suplex was such an
upgrade when it came to reading:
- it's more comfortable for longer periods of time, because it allows
  a firmer grip
- it's less distracting, because you can only see one page at a time
- it leaves a mark (remember, books are punching bags!)

Here's a picture I took after turning the last page of the book that
had
tortured me for the majority of my career:

{{< figure src="/img/finished-devops-handbook.jpg" position="center" caption="DONE!" >}}

So, **here is my challenge to you**. Before moving on to [Part 2](#part-2), find a book you feel OK
experimenting on (including this text if you are reading it in book
version!) and apply a clean, *strong* book suplex to it, as flat as
you can make it. It doesn't matter if it is a softcover or hardcover; the book suplex will work on any book, [including the dictionary](/img/larousse-fold.jpg). Most people fear that the book will instantly break
in half, but in my experience that never happens. You generally have
to work pretty hard to even get a single page to fall out of a book,
trust me. Even if it does, it's *not* a big deal. If you follow my
method, you won't even keep the book when you are done with it! So,
show it who's the boss. Yes, it's going to leave a mark
on the spine, but that's also the point. See how this new experience
feels on your hands, on your eyes. Get comfortable. Try suplexing the
early pages of the book, then the middle pages, then the final pages.
Observe the difference. Realize that books have been around for
hundreds of years and that they are *tough*, dependable objects.


You don't have to try it if it makes you uncomfortable: I don't want
to force you to break your precious things. Indeed, I take no responsibility in
the damage anyone makes to their own material :wink:. Before I move
on, though, I will point out that if you feel like you have tried
everything and that learning anxiety is still looming over you, it
might be worth giving the book suplex a shot, if only for the
cathartic experience of using your hands to crush something that made
you feel like a prisoner.

Freedom!!

# Part 2

## Chapter 5: Creating a system of learning

So, I knew how to hold a book. Big whoop. This didn't change the fact
that after reading 10 pages, I couldn't contain all the information I
was reading. If 10 pages of info coming in my brain means 10 pages of
info coming out, that does not count as learning. That is the
equivalent of passively listening to radio while driving. All your
mind really records is the ads.

This time, something was different though. Folding my paperback opened
Pandora's box. Now that I was unafraid to hurt the resell value of my
books, a world of possibilities became accessible.

Many attempts were made before stumbling upon my learning system. We
learn by doing. At first, I tried to take notes directly in the book
using a pen.  While this new experience felt great to do in the
moment, it didn't have any lasting effect. I then tried to do the same
thing with a yellow highlighter, as I had heard in primary school that
the color yellow makes it easier to remember things. That was baloney.
The problem in both cases is that having to flip through tens of pages
just to view my notes was inconvenient. While it felt good to interact
with the words on the pages, it didn't help me remember anything! It
was at that moment that my partner Gabrielle said something very wise:

> You should never have to read a book or textbook more than once. If
> you take good notes, once you finish a book, you can consider
> yourself done with it.

She was so right about that, even though it took me a few days to
admit it. This went against my core belief that books are meant to be
kept as reference material. After all, almost every content creator on
the Internet who is a self-declared book reader will proudly display
their bookshelf in the background of their videos. When I realized the
wisdom in Gabrielle's words, I decided to be a contrarian. My library,
if I were to have one, would be filled by books I wrote, and empty of
books I read. This gave me a new motivation: whatever system I'd use
for learning, it would be a system that doesn't depend on maintaining
access to the source material. In fact, after she told me this, I
realized the best course of action was to systematically give the book
away once I am done reading it. It is the simplest, safest and most
elegant way to ensure my learning system is working.

I didn't have to search for very long after that insight to have my
eureka moment. Armed with the rule of giving my book once I'm done
reading it, I started searching for ideas online that would cement my
learning system. [This six-minutes long video from Matt Morris titled
\'How to Read a Book for Maximum
Learning\'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WCfaGarc4U) fit the bill.

What I want you to remember from this chapter is that my learning
system didn't just fall on me from the heavens. I failed a bunch of
times before stumbling upon a process that worked for me. I asked my
partner for help and suggestions when I realized I was out of ideas. I
searched on YouTube for insight. I was at my most vulnerable then,
because I was basically admitting that I needed help. I had overcome
the learning anxiety on the topic of learning itself.

It might not look like much, just asking someone or a search engine
for help, but this is huge!  It requires tremendous courage to try new
things, fall on your face, and ask for help. I tip my hat to anyone
who experiences personal hardships and has the courage to look for
assistance before trying again.  That's how major psychological
breakthroughs begin. In a way, that is what you chose to do by
starting to read this text (and look at you, still reading!). So,
let's take a minute to celebrate the fact that you chose to hear my
advice, and that despite all the distractions in the world, you are
still paying attention and making progress. You're awesome! :tada:

I can't say for sure if your final learning system will look like
mine. But however your brain learns, you'll have to fail before you
get good. So remember that **each humbling failure is a step closer to
mastery, and rejoice that you are making real progress.**

Alright, enough talking, let's start doing. It's time I share with you
how I actually learn.

## Chapter 6: My current learning system

In this chapter, I will teach you exactly how I learned everything I
know. You will notice that my method relies on using physical books.
If you'd rather read digital books, the main steps will stay roughly the same.
If you learn better from audiobooks or podcasts, you might have to
find workarounds.

What I want you to remember is that it's ok if your
preferred way of learning is different from mine. At the end of the
day, what matters is that you find joy in using your system and that
it gives you the results you want.

Alright, let's get started. If you want to try my learning system, you
will need, in addition to your chosen book:

- a notebook
- a pen
- a highlighter
- a ruler that fits in your notebook

Make sure that each of these items are objects that you personally
enjoy using. I'll nerd out [in a later section of the Appendix about
the hardware I use](#additional-tips-on-hardware), but for now just
focus on making sure that whatever gear you end up choosing makes you
want to read/write more, not less! If you can, I suggest you try to do these steps in real time on this text as you learn about them.

### Step 1: Read and highlight the golden nuggets

Crack open the book at page 1 (or simply continue reading here). We are embarking on a journey. If you
didn't try the book suplex yet, consider doing it now.  Have a
highlighter in your hand and start reading. Highlight whatever golden
nuggets of information *you* find interesting. That's it!

Whenever I highlight something, I don't care if this is something the
author expected me to memorize or not. If a sentence resonates with me, if I'd
like to keep this sentence floating in my brain, that's the signal to
highlight it. Often
times I even take pride in highlighting a little detail that feels
irrelevant in the scope of the whole book but that *I* connect with.
Do not be scared by this freedom: follow your instinct. There is no
test at the end [^1].

As you read, don't bother trying to remember everything. Personally,
when I turn a page, I feel completely OK not remembering what I just
read! Read your book like you're watching a TV show or listening to a
podcast.  Highlight as you go, and know that we will come back to
collect all these little knowledge nuggets later. :wink:

{{< figure src="/img/mining-for-golden-nuggets.jpg" position="center" caption="Highlighting = identifying the gold nuggets." >}}

### Step 2: Write down your highlights

When you're done with the book (or whenever you feel like it,
really!), get your notebook out. We will now go back to the beginning
of the book and flip page by page looking for any nugget you
identified earlier.

Why take the time to write by hand all of these nuggets? I'm glad you
asked.

Firstly, this will make it much easier for you to focus on the
*useful* content of the book whenever you want to revisit its ideas
later. Think about it: your notes will be all the *good stuff*. No
distractions. Pure gold, selected by you!

Secondly, and in my opinion most importantly, writing a nugget forces
it to get decoded by your brain, even if only briefly. Indeed, any
sentence that goes into your notebook was seen by your eye, decoded by
your brain, and crafted by your hand's muscles. For your memory, this
process is much richer than just reading words, which only involves
the eye and the brain. By writing your highlights, you are immersing
your entire body in the book. Reading diagonally is often tempting;
*writing* diagonally is much more difficult to pull off, if not
impossible. It's a hard experience to describe, as it is both
incredibly simple and profoundly powerful. I think you'll have to give
it a shot to really *get* it.

Thirdly, as I wrote earlier in [Chapter
5](#chapter-5-creating-a-system-of-learning), you want to do
everything you can *not* to depend on having access to the book once
you're done with it. The goal of producing complete notes is to allow
you to unshackle from the book and claim this knowledge as your own.

In this process of going through the book a second time to collect
your nuggets, feel free to not even look at the pages without
highlights. I mean, why would you? You already read them and clearly
haven't identified anything of value there. Trust your instinct: move
on! It feels good when you can skip over a bunch of pages empty of
nuggets.

{{< figure src="/img/lecture-notes-cas.jpg" position="center" caption="Writing notes = capturing knowledge nuggets" >}}

As you can see in the picture above, I don't really bother rephrasing
the quotes from the book. The only time I'll rephrase something is if
I can make it shorter, or if I find the original sentence hard to
understand. Your mileage may vary, though. Some people tell me you
*have* to reword quotes you get from a book. To each their own!

Personally, I love this step of writing highlights on paper. I often
do this while listening to music, or while watching a video in the
background. It's very relaxing. Just go at your own pace and stop when
you've had your fill.

### Step 3: Find your Star Quotes

So you read a book, you made some highlights, and you took some
notes. Are all of these notes good? On average, I would say about 60%
of them are truly worth keeping. Indeed, some quotes are redundant, or
don't make much sense out of context. Therefore, a very powerful thing
I enjoy doing before right before I review a book is reading my notes
one last time and identifying which quotes I want to include in my
review. I call those :star: Star Quotes :star:.

This process is useful because it forces you to:
- read the material one more time, which ups your
  chances of remembering it later
- remove the quotes you initially liked, but don't
  really have lasting value

What is neat in finding your Star Quotes is that you follow exactly
the same method you developed in [Step
1](#step-1-read-and-highlight-the-golden-nuggets), but on your notes.
Of course, you might be tempted to highlight most of the material found
in your notes, and that's ok. That means your initial selection was
relevant!

See in the image below the quotes identified by a bit of highlighter.
These are my Star Quotes. They will be included in my review of the
book, which happens in the next step.

{{< figure src="/img/highlight-star-quotes.png" position="center" caption="" >}}

Psst, I have created [a free book version of all my Star Quotes](/star-quotes) if you are interested.

### Step 4: Write about your opinion of the book

This might seem like overkill to most, but I wouldn't even think of
skipping this step. Once I'm done with a book, I want to formulate my
own opinion about what I just read in the form of a review. This is
what cements it in my brain and makes me feel like I own the ideas I'm
discussing.

Since I use my website as a platform for reviewing the books I read,
sometimes I get stage fright. "What will people think of me if I write
this and that in my review?" In a way, reviewing books also forces me
to face my fear of rejection.

In my reviews, I give myself the freedom to be as detailed or as brief
as I want. In a way, I treat a review like an artist would treat a
canvas: whatever ends up there is simply a reflection of how I *felt*
about the book. There's a good amount of intuition that goes into this
process.  Sure, I try to put a minimum of effort in my reviews, but I
also try not to overdo it. After all, this is something I do for
myself. I have to find enjoyment in it, otherwise I know I will get
discouraged.

Finally, I suggest you include in your review all the Star Quotes you
identified in [Step 3](#step-3-find-your-star-quotes). If will be very
convenient to be able to use `Ctrl-F` (or `grep`) to search specific
quotes later on.

[As an example, here is the latest review I wrote](/latest). Feel free
to copy my format if you want, or create your own. In the end, what
matters is that you create a pattern of work that tricks your brain
into thinking about these ideas and have them make sense for you. You
get bonus points if you make this review public: not only are you
sharing your knowledge, but you also encourage people to participate
in your journey and initiate discussions with you.

A nice side effect of posting your reviews on a website is that you
can implement custom visualizations. For example, I have a [virtual bookshelf](/bookshelf) that I can use
to retrieve my notes and even share them with interested parties.

{{< figure src="/img/virtual-bookshelf.png" position="center" caption="[My virtual bookshelf](/bookshelf)" >}}

Ultimately, the format you use to review your books doesn't matter. It can be a
website like me, a fresh page in your notebook, a Word document, an
email, a spreadsheet, etc. As long as you use _your_ words to write
about the subject you read about, you will do fine. The easiest it is
for you to access that information once you're done, the better.

That's it, really! However, since I am very passionate about this
subject, I can't resist sharing some additional tips. Head over to the
[Appendix](#appendix) for more precise tricks.

## Chapter 7: Conclusion

> *The only sustainable competitive advantage is the ability to
> learn faster than the competition.*
>
> -- Peter Senge, *The Fifth Discipline*

I find the image below very telling. My learning system allowed me to
compress a 421-page book down to its essential learning nuggets, which
take only 50 handwritten pages in my A5-sized journal. This means I
will get as much information from reading these 50 pages than from
reading 421 pages.

{{< figure src="/img/compressed-book.jpg" position="center" caption="50 pages of pure nuggets!" >}}

Instead of taking days to review that information, it will take me 1
hour. This feels almost like cheating, except it isn't! I worked hard
for this outcome, and now I get to savour it. Better yet, since all
the crucial information is compact and written by me and for me, the
ideas assemble in my head much quicker than if I was just reading the
book all over again. The information has been pre-digested.

Books are not something to be afraid of. Not anymore. I realized I now
get to decide which book I read. As a professional, I am the master of
my own learning. This ability to learn allowed me to find a quote that
I now live by, hidden deep into the DevOps Handbook at the end of page 320 of its second edition. It appears at the beginning of this chapter.

Textbooks have a purpose outside the classroom, even if that means you
won't have a professor dragging you through it. Not all textbooks
feature exercises and homework; some can be quite fun, relaxing,
enlightening to read, without creating headaches or feeling like
puzzles. A book you chose almost certainly contains parts of the
answer to the question that made you choose it.

Imagine how you will feel when your book shows you a new way to think
about a specific problem you couldn't quite figure out. Suddenly, a
new connection occurs in your brain. Now, all you can see is the
answer.  Everything simply  makes  sense! Personally, this is among
the most powerful and freeing experiences I have felt yet. It truly is
a transcending moment that cannot be overstated. In the beginning,
reading books felt painful. Now, I am addicted.

**We are all lifelong learners.** If you want to learn about
something, you can do it. What allows some people to learn faster than
others is that they have created and optimized a learning system that
is suited for *their* way of learning.  When I realized that the core
mission of DevOps, which eluded me for years, is to create a system
that automates organizational learning, I felt the pinch of irony
since this realization had required me to create *my* own system of
learning. Now that this is done, I feel more empowered than ever and
ready to take this challenge head-on.

I don't want to give you the wrong impression: I am definitely still
not immune to learning anxiety, even after reading {{< n_books >}}
books and writing all about my experience. [Nobody gets used to
feeling dumb](/69), and unfortunately the more you learn, the more you
realize how little you actually know about everything. The good news
is that I now feel equipped to tackle this journey. I'll never be done
learning, and true learning is always an uncomfortable, if not painful
process. Nevertheless, my learning system allowed me to come across
pieces of wisdom that radically changed my relationships and my life
for the better.  I cannot even begin to express the sheer magnitude
that the ability to read non-fiction books had on my life. I do not
feel crippling anxiety when I step into the office every morning. I do
not feel afraid to give my opinion on important topics. In fact, now
more than ever, when I speak to friends and colleagues, I feel valued
and genuinely interesting.

Yet, I am *overcoming* learning anxiety. I am not done, and probably
never will be. I am *learning* that pain can be leveraged. I am
*starting* to believe that the only real failure is not to learn from
failure. I am *beginning* to see fear as a compass that guides us
toward the path that will make us grow. I'm still scared of exams, and
I honestly still fear getting fired from time to time! Some things are
a unfortunately part of life. What I learned is that by arming
ourselves with knowledge, our problems become more interesting, more
fulfilling, and closer to our true ambitions.

If you personally suffer from learning anxiety and made it this far in
this blog post, I am in awe of you. [The last mile is always the least
crowded](/40), and you are among the courageous few that made it to
the end. Seriously, lift your favorite arm and give yourself a pat on
the back from me. I am confident that you are already on the right
path: the real journey begins here, if you accept it. I hope the ideas
I have outlined above will inspire you to give them a try or, better
yet, to find your own system and rediscover the simple, sacred joy of
learning. If this changes your life even half as much as it changed
mine, you're in for the ride of a lifetime, my friend.

We truly can do anything we set our mind to. That is what learning is
all about.

Your move!

# Appendix: Additional tips

In this section, I will tell you about some tricks I picked up over
years of learning from books. If you have other interesting tricks you
would like to share, please let me know in the comments below! :pray:

## Tip 1: Never go out without your book, highlighter and pen

Personally, I feel naked whenever I go somewhere without my book, my notebook, my pen and my highlighter. 

It is impossible make progress in a book you don't have access to. One can't highlight golden nuggets without a highlighter in hand. 

If you want to get serious about your reading habits, you need to find a way to have these objects available at all times. The closer they are to your hands, the better.

It doesn't have to be complicated. If you travel with a bag, that's an obvious spot to store your books. If you have pockets, that's an obvious place for a pen and highlighter.

To tell the truth, you don't really need a bag or pockets to make this
tip work. You could simply keep your book and highlighter in your
hands and your pen behind your ear for the few times you might need
it. No clothes required!

If you are dying for a bag recommendation, [here\'s the bag I use when I\'m traveling.](https://amzn.to/4bjCaa3) It's light, it's compact when stored, and gets the job done every time.

## Tip 2: Grab your book before grabbing your phone

In my experience, the best way to progress through a book is *not* to allocate long
periods of time for reading, but rather to keep your book handy at all
times (see tip #1) and to open it whenever you're between tasks.

When I manage to motivate people to pick up
reading again, their intuitive response is generally to say "I'll set
an hour aside in my calendar for reading." And they do. And then
nothing else happens. They are still unable to turn reading into a
habit! 

Do you want to know a dirty secret? I have trouble reading for more than 30
minutes in a row. I doubt most people who schedule to read a full
uninterrupted hour actually succeed. In my opinion, they mostly end up
fooling themselves.

Fortunately, I bring good news. I have found the perfect solution to
instantly bake reading into your routine. But you have to stick to it,
otherwise it will not work.

Ready? Here it is: Any time you feel like picking up your phone to
browse, pick your book first, and see if you can read a paragraph or
two (or more, if you get into it!) before using your phone.

Let me put this another way: Earn the right to use your phone by reading two paragraphs from your book first.

How was that? Disappointing, right? Well, too bad, that really is the
secret sauce to finishing books quickly! :smiley:

If you try it, I'm certain you'll be amazed by
the results. The majority of us are addicted to our phones, and this tip turns our addiction into something positive. Change your phone's wallpaper to remind you to read if
you need to. 

After some time, if you're anything like me, you might come to *prefer* reading your book than using your phone. Indeed, why waste time searching for inconsequential content online when the content you really care about is right there in your book?

Caveat: For this tip to work, you *must* have your book and your highlighter on you (tip #1) pretty much all the time. It's worth it!

### Tip 2.1: Buy an alarm clock and leave your phone out of the bedroom

Kudos to Simon Sinek for this tip. Most people keep their phones next
to their bed because it serves as their morning alarm clock. That is a
terrible practice, for we know how damaging it is for our eyes and
minds to use our phones before going to sleep. Try adopting a different
strategy that generations of people before you have relied on to go to
sleep: get yourself an alarm clock ([here\'s the one I
use](https://amzn.to/3W6QL4z)), migrate your phone's charger outside
of your bedroom, and bring your book to bed instead. Not only will
this make you read more, but it will also make your sleep better.

## Tip 3: Start by reading a single book at a time

As you start learning, you get excited when you see all the
possibilities within your grasp. Never forget, "Stop starting, start
finishing." Generally, for better or for worse, the end of the book is
often when everything comes together and the author "blows your mind."

{{< figure src="/img/stop-starting-start-finishing.jpg" position="center" caption="Words to live by." >}}

Choose your book carefully, and do your best not to start another one
before you finished your current one. Use this as motivation to get
through your current book, if needed!

Personally, shelving  a book without finishing it only leaves me more
confused. It gives me some pieces of the puzzle, but since I lack
pieces I will never see that puzzle to completion. Bite the bullet,
and finish the books you start, unless they are novels that fail to
grab your attention.

You might want to wait  until you are in the final pages of a book
before ordering your next one. You don't want to make commitments that
you might not be able to complete! I strongly advise to order only a
single book at a time, especially at the start of your learning
journey - don't get carried away!


## Tip 4: Track your progress by folding the corners

This is a big part of my system.

In my younger years, I vaguely remember coming across an online debate about using
bookmarks vs. folding corners. In the past, I would have been in the
bookmark camp, but I'm now clearly a folded corners guy.

Each page has two corners and I use this to my full advantage. The top
corner indicates my reading progress, and the bottom corner indicates
my note-taking progress. And no risk of having your bookmark fall out
of the book!

{{< figure src="/img/folded-corners-system.png" position="center" caption="" >}}

I can't overstate how useful this is. It gives the feeling that no
moment spent reading or taking notes is wasted. Whenever something
else needs my attention, I simply fold the corner, fully aware that
whenever I'll come back to the book, I will know exactly what I was up
to. Often, I will even leave a mark with my highlighter next to the sentence I was
currently reading to mark the spot I was at. Simply put, it reduces my cognitive load to a minimum.

I also like the fact that this transforms the act of learning into two
distinct activities:
- reading
- writing (note-taking)

If I'm in the mood for reading, I read. If I'm in the mood for
writing, I write. I feel like I am free to choose what activity is
right for what time. And, most importantly, whatever I end up
choosing, I am constantly learning.

## Tip 5: Use the body of your highlighter as a visual aid

When I picture someone reading, I often see them using their finger to
track their progress, like this:

{{< figure src="/img/reading-with-finger.png" position="center" caption="" >}}

{{< figure src="/img/reading-with-finger.jpg"
position="center" caption="" >}}

However, this method of tracking progress never felt right to me.
There are many reasons why:

- My finger is too big to accurately point to specific words on a page
- To reach the full width of the page with my finger, I have to move
  my entire arm back and forth as I read, or move the arm holding the
  book. It wastes energy.
- I don't particularly appreciate the friction of the page on the tip
  of my index, especially over extended periods of time.

The method I now use to guide my eyes as I read is to use the full
body of my highlighter. Since my system is based on Matt Morris'
learning strategy, I always have a highlighter in my hands when I
read, so this puts it to good use.

{{< figure src="/img/read-with-highlighter.jpg" position="center" caption="" >}}

This has many benefits:

- Unlike the tip of your finger, the body of the highlighter is flat.
  It makes it obvious what line you are currently looking at.
- You can let your eyes glide along the body of the highlighter. It
  feels less jittery than following the movement of a finger, which
  can only point to one word at a time.
- The body of the highlighter is:
   - long enough to allow me to reach the full width of a page without
     having to move my wrist, let alone my arm.
   - vivid in color, which makes it quite eye-catching.
   - wide enough to hide the sentences below what I am reading, which
     ensures I am not reading "in diagonal".

## Tip 6: Get the right grip

If you plan on reading for long periods of time, you need a way to get
comfortable. Fortunately, I believe I have found an easy way that will
work for most people. This is what is looks like:

{{< figure src="/img/how-hold-a-book-1.jpg" position="center" caption="" >}} 

As you can see, one hand holds the book, and the other holds the
highlighter. I have already described in [Tip
#5](#tip-5-use-the-body-of-your-highlighter-as-a-visual-aid)
how to use your highlighter as a visual aid. Personally, I really like
leaving my index between the front and back cover, because it creates
a nice support without being in my eyes' way. When you reach the end
of the page, simply switch hands!

{{< figure src="/img/how-hold-a-book-2.jpg" position="center" caption="" >}} 

## Tip 7: Use creative highlighting to help your future self take efficient notes

When we highlight in a book, we highlight for our future self who will
turn these highlights into written notes. Our goal is to make that
future self's job as easy as possible.

Most of the time, there isn't a lot of thought that goes into
highlighting -- that's a good thing! If you find a sentence that you
love, just highlight it. Easy peasy. But what if the useful
information is split across different sentences? What if by switching
some words around you can make its meaning more obvious to you?

Take the example below:

{{< figure src="/img/construct-sentences-3.png" position="center" caption="" >}} 

The original quote is:

> "Validating your feelings" sounds like a big term, but it really
> means one thing: It's just letting yourself have them.

I don't need to remember that "'Validating your feelings' sounds like
a big term that really means one thing." What I want to remember is
that validating your feelings is just letting yourself have them. And
so that's exactly what I highlight:

> "Validating your feelings" [...]'s just letting yourself have them.

This approach works a lot of the time, but there are some exceptions.
For example, see what I did in the example below. It was simpler to
simply write the missing bits with a pen instead of trying to
reconstruct a quote using words already on the page.

{{< figure src="/img/construct-sentences-2.png" position="center" caption="" >}} 

This technique also works to cut the fat in a mostly relevant
paragraph. See in the example below how I string together different sentences
using a simple line.

{{< figure src="/img/construct-sentences-1.png" position="center" caption="" >}} 


Finally, I noticed that some authors like to create enumerations in prose
instead of in a list form. In order to help my future note-taking
self, I use my pen to circle where each element of an enumeration
begins in a paragraph. It makes the information much easier to parse
later on. It also signals that this information would be more visually
striking if written as a list:

- First, ...
- Second, ...

## Tip 8: Use your book's margins and blank pages to write ideas

If reading a certain paragraph triggers a light bulb in your mind or
makes you pause and wonder about a specific question, I recommend that
you write that thought in the margins next to the paragraph that
inspired it. That way, when writing your notes, you will be able to
revisit your own good ideas and decide how to expand upon them.

{{< figure src="/img/good-margin-notes.jpg" position="center" caption="" >}}

If you consider reviewing your book when you are done with it (which I
recommend!), you might want to write your impressions of the book near
the front cover for ease of retrieval, as I have done in the picture
below for the book [The Mountain Is You](/88).

Don't let a good idea go to waste!  :smile:

## Tip 9: Number your notebook's pages

If your notebook doesn't have page numbers already (most don't), I
strongly recommend that you number your pages yourself. This is
invaluable to allow you to reference your own notes later on. This is a
quality of life upgrade that is too obvious to live without.

If you have to number your notebook's pages, take this opportunity to
use a different ink color (e.g. red) than what you would use for your
note-taking. Things will look much clearer when you reach the bottom
right
corner of odd-numbered pages. :wink:

## Tip 10: If your notebook doesn't have margins, make some!

For most of my life, I assumed the margin was meant for graders to
review your work and comment on their corrections. Well, news flash:
the margin is for everybody!

It's a shame that most quality notebooks that I know of don't have
margins. Use this to your advantage: make your margins as wide or as
thin as you need.

{{< figure src="/img/margins.jpg" position="center" caption="" >}}

In my notes, sometimes I write questions or things that will need
further updates. The margins are the perfect place to put such updates.
Of course, not all of your notes will require a margin note, but
that's a good thing: it leaves you with more room for the notes that
truly need commenting later on.

## Tip 11: Write the source of your knowledge nuggets in your margins

{{< figure src="/img/notes-source.png" position="center" caption="" >}}

Notice in the photo above that most "knowledge nuggets" are paired
with a reference to the source material. This helps finding context or
correcting notes in the rare cases where your notes are unclear and
you must refer to the book. Trust me, it can save you a lot of time,
and also makes sharing that nugget in the future even easier (e.g. "As
the *DevOps Handbook* says on page 49, improvement of daily work is
even more important than daily work!").

Side effects may include people calling you a bookworm.

## Tip 12: Use a URL shortener to encode web links in your notebook

This is very nerdy, but also very cool *and* useful. See an example in
the image below:

{{< figure src="/img/note-short-url.png" position="center" caption="" >}}

See that strange `(F)/bcm`? The circled F is a shorthand for
https://felx.cc. If you visit https://felx.cc/bcm, you'll be taken to
this much longer link instead:
https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNkyXbkGnqpbp38J_f57sodGkG801H4lzJiwqTcInRbMmU38EKrqHbP28fZ9afKpw?key=WVB3UWdrUHNxS3duR0loTXY4ZEU5d084X29iSGp3,
which is a photo I took of a page in a book for convenience. Thus,
https://felx.cc/bcm is my short URL: it is convenient to type on any
device, and can redirect me to a much more unwieldy URL.

A URL shortener is a service that allows you to create a small
link that can redirect to a link of any length. This is invaluable: it
allows me to save important, complicated links directly alongside my
reading notes, where I know they will be most useful.

If you are interested in trying a URL shortening service, many
services already offer free tiers:

- https://bitly.com/
- https://www.shorturl.at/
- https://tinyurl.com/app
- https://cutt.ly/fr
- https://free-url-shortener.rb.gy/
- https://t.ly/
- ...

They all do the same thing. Turn big URLs into small URLs.

However, if you're a computer nerd and would like to possess *your*
own URL shortening service (like I do with https://felx.cc/, that is
fully owned by me!), I recommend you check out [a video I made on how
to get started with
VanityURL](/posts/2024/01/vanityurls-a-convenient-diy-url-shortener-service/).

## Tip 13: Give your book away after you wrote your review

This is the fun part. When you finished reading a book and collecting
all its nuggets in your journal, you are free to share it with the
world. In fact, I think it's better to bring the book out of your home
and find it a new library where it will be happy. In my case, since my
employer sometimes provides me a personal wellness account that funds
my book purchases, I think it's a no-brainer to bring these books back
to the office, where I know they will benefit my colleagues.

Writing the Slack message announcing the newly available book in the
library is the victory lap.

{{< figure src="/img/book-sharing.png" position="center" caption="" >}}

For the *DevOps Handbook*, since this book meant a lot for me during
my personal development, I added a little note on the title page. Who
knows, maybe this little encouragement will make a difference for the
next person who will pick up this book!

## Tip 14: Remember: Reading a book twice is inefficient

I've hinted at it before, but I'll say it clearly once more: If you
are reading a book a second time, what does this say about the first
time you read it? Life if too short to read a book in its entirety
twice.  Instead, rely on your notes to quickly get the essence of the
book.  That's your reward for putting in this work: you can get the
same info as reading the full book in a fraction of the time.

## Tip 15: Additional tips on hardware

Alright, we are now getting into the nitty-gritty. For most of us,
making a purchase is the fun, exciting part. My dopamine-hungry brain
loves it when I buy stuff.

So, what hardware do I recommend, precisely?

#### Notebook

First off, this is probably basic common-sense, but I'll make it
explicit, just in case: Don't use a spiral-bound Hilroy notebook or,
worse, a stitched exercise book. These won't do much good here if
pages keep tearing and falling out of your journal after a few years.

The bound journal I've been using is the [TRU RED Medium Flexible
Cover Dotted
Journal](https://www.staples.ca/products/2934243-en-tru-red-medium-flexible-cover-dotted-journal-black)
from Staples.

{{< figure src="/img/use-bound-journals.png" position="center" caption="" >}}

Note: Some people enjoy spiral-bound notebooks because they allow to
easily fold back the notebook and stay opened flat on a table. If you
do invest in a spiral-notebook, at least make sure it is high quality.


Also, I strongly recommend to use a **dotted** journal.  This
allows better horizontal alignment of information for writing lists.
It makes my messy handwriting look less messy. Personally, I am now
very fond of dotted journals, because they provide the benefits of a
grid without being as visually distracting.

#### Pens and highlighters

Take the time to really search for a pen that makes writing a joyful
experience for *you*.

If you're looking for recommendations, mine are:
- Pen: Bic Cristal (black or blue)
- Highlighter: Something basic and colorful, like [those sold at
  Staples](https://www.staples.ca/products/496808-en-chisel-tip-tank-style-highlighters-yellow-20-pack)

Why?

- They are cheap, easy to find and reliable
- The Bic Cristal does not smear (I'm left handed)
- The highlighter has lots of ink and lasts a long time

{{< figure scale="400px" src="/img/bic-cristal-and-highlighter.jpg" position="center" caption="" >}}

For more details about how I chose the Bic Cristal as my main pen, see
[The Bic Cristal Story](/posts/2024/07/the-bic-cristal/).


#### Ruler

This allows you to make nice lines, for margins, tables or underlines. Any
cheap 15 cm ruler will do. It makes your journal more pleasing to
read, which is important. After all, the whole point of keeping a
journal is so you can comfortably refer to your knowledge.

The best storage place I found for my ruler is directly in my
notebook. The notebook I recommend above has an elastic band that
ensures your ruler would never slip and fall once shut.
