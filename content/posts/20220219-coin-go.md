Yesterday, I was daydreaming about Go and had an idea that never occurred to me before: what if Go had inner
walls? How would this re-shape the game?

At first, I considered the variant to be "Tengen no Go": have a wall/pillar/coin at the center of the board to
prevent any player from playing there. I thought this would be interesting because every game of Go starts
from the corners and meet at the center. How would the symmetry of removing the center impact the game?

Turns out, some fellow Go players on Reddit commented that the game would devolve into "Mirror Go", a game
where White always has the advantage over Black. Thus, a generalization of the idea took place: what if any
intersection could be removed as a valid playing spot? This has the potential of creating even more
interesting asymmetries.

After discussing with players online, here are the rules I propose for the Coin Go variant:

> Normal rules of Go apply. In **Coin Go**, a stone cannot be played on certain intersections of the board by either player. A coin may be
placed on these intersections as a visual aid. Stones adjacent to a coin are limited to 3 liberties (the
fourth one being occupied by the coin).
>
> There are different ways to determine intersections occupied by coins:
>
> - Intersections are chosen (randomly or not) at the beginning of the game before either player takes a turn. A possible alternative is players alternate taking turns to place coins on the board.
>
> - An even number of coins is split between both players. The game begins with no coins on the board. Players may use a turn to place a coin on the board.
> - (The two methods above can also be combined)
>
> Coins may not be captured. For scoring, coins do not contribute to territory. Normal scoring rules apply.

Although I have not yet tried this variant myself, I'm pretty sure that it has potential, due to its
flexibility. Forum users even suggested crazier setups:

- Give an equal amount of coins (3?) to each player at the start of the game. Players may spend these coins by placing them on the board or by removing one of the coins already on the board.

I have taken the liberty to edit the [Wikipedia entry for Go
variants](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_variants#Coin_Go) to add Coin Go. I hope this idea will take off!

Note that someone has already created a [tool that can generate images of Go boards with removed intersections
where coins would be placed](https://shinuito.github.io/nxnboard.html). For example, here is what a 19x19 board with 10 "coins" would look like:

Let me know if you give this variant a shot! :smile:
