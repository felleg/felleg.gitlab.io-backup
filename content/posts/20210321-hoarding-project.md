Started collecting video games in 2011 when got disposable income

Made friends along the way, I still have these friends. It's hard to get out of the pattern when all your
friends are also doing it. Makes me think about alcoholics or drug users, I better understand where they are
coming from now. It's hard to decide between leaving your addiction and potentially distancing yourself from
your friends.

In 2020, during covid I made a lot of introspection. I felt the time was right to make changes in my life. I
stumbled upon a resource that nailed exactly how I felt about my video game collection. [Video by Dr. Dawn
