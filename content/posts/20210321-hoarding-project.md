Those that know me personally know that I have been collecting video games (among other things) for a long
time. So long, in fact, that it probably felt like it was part of my DNA. At my peak, I owned 455 unique
games. This number doesn't account for controllers, consoles, TV screens, cables and adapters, etc. On top of
that, I owned 200 musical albums, evenly split between CDs and vinyls discs, and some 30 books and novels.

When I was 16, if I had seen that picture online, I would have dreamed to live in that bedroom. But life sure
has its ways. Now that I have experienced the reality of owning all of that stuff, I want to share the story
of how I realized my collection was bringing me more pain than joy, and how I managed to let it all go (well,
most of it).

# I owned a lot of stuff

I started collecting video games in 2011 when I got disposable income. I had not collected anything in my life
before then. I still vividly remember the rush of walking in the game store and looking at all these old
games, artifacts of a different era. Some of them I had always wanted to try, some of them I had never heard
of. They fascinated me. Of course, my parents were not thrilled, but it was my money so I made my own
decisions.

Over the years, I made friends inside the video gaming community. In fact, one of my closest friends came from
this community (you know who you are)!  By being able to put our interests in common, we were empowering
ourselves to go deeper in this hobby than any of us had previously thought possible. It's very easy to get in
a rabbit hole when all your friends are also doing it. But that's also what makes it hard to stop: it's hard
to decide between leaving your "addiction" and potentially distancing yourself from your friends.

# Living Small

In America, the dream society gives us is to live large, but there is something to be said about living small.

Growing up, I had the luxury of having a bedroom that could almost contain my current kitchen and living room
combined. It wasn't particularly fancy, but it sure was big. It was filled to the brim, not only with my own
stuff, but with my father's hoardings too!

Moving into my second apartment (this time with my partner), things got small. However big you imagine my
first bedroom, here's the new space I could claim in the apartment (excluding hard to access storage):

True story, for some months, I stored my entire collection next to my washing machine. Admittedly, not the
sexiest storage strategy, but I needed to fit it somewhere...

Eventually, I decided to buy a Billy bookcase to display my favorite items, but that also had its limits. It
was double stacked all the time. Overall, the magic seemed lost.

I realized that something was wrong when I noticed that I played video games less than once a month.
I had over $20,000 worth of games that I had to care for and insure, and derived less then 50 hours of game time per year.
The hobby that had defined me for what felt like the longest part of my life didn't suit me anymore.

# Considering a change

In 2020, during covid I made a lot of introspection. I felt the time was right to make changes in my life. My
collection had been weighing me down for a while. I
stumbled upon [a resource that nailed exactly how I felt about my possessions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVDiux8NEWo).
Another [video by Toy Galaxy about the stages of collecting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aalm8VUuFDk) also
hit the nail on the head for me. This all made me realize how ready I was for a change.

To be fair, this process had already begun years ago. In 2018, I had already started selling what I considered
"junk" in my collection. By "junk", I mean objects that I hadn't touched in over 3 years.

Still, it's interesting how much I learned through this journey. I learned a lot of video games facts, but I
also learned so much more. I learned to make my own opinions. Believe it or not, I was once part of the group
that wanted to fit in by saying [The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time was the best game ever made by
Nintendo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST3Bq4PJq50&feature=youtu.be). When that video was made, in 2008, I
hadn't played more than a total of 2 hours of the game. I just assumed it was the best game, since everywhere
I looked (for the longest time), the game came out on top all the time, even 10 years after its original
release. Coincidentally, after giving it the time it deserves, I can safely say that the game is just not for
me and even ranks as some of my least enjoyable gaming experiences. In my honest opinion, it's a slow, boring
game that happens to be very stylish. Just the total opposite of what I'm looking for in a game: I like fun
games that look bad.
