The goal: play 7 games with strangers over the span of 7 days. This is to force me to let go of my ego, and
face head-on my fear of losing in order to become a better player (and a better person!).

- Game 1 (lost): https://online-go.com/game/41699537
- Game 2 (lost): https://online-go.com/game/41734993
- Game 3 (lost): https://online-go.com/game/41785832
- Game 4 (won! maybe because I was listening to [this](https://barxmusic.bandcamp.com/album/in-gear)?): https://online-go.com/game/41808352
- Game 5 (robot opponent, lost): https://online-go.com/game/41895466
- Game 6 (lost): https://online-go.com/game/41895871

Well, all in all, I ended up being 1 game short. I still gave it my best, though. I feel less scared about
losing the game. Each loss is still painful, but the pain gets gradually lessened with each game, thankfully.
I'll try to do this again sometime in the future!

(Update) Here is the seventh game. A little late, but it did happen!
