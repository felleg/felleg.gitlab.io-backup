üëç - Terrific ideas. This book inspires me to try to show what management can change to tap into the unexplored potential that lives in every human. I think every C-level manager should explore the ideas discussed in this book and see if they resonate with them. This is the future of work.

Read [the notes I wrote](/books/reinventing-organizations.pdf) from this book.
