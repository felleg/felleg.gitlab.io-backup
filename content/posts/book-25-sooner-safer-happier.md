👍👍 - Mind-blowing. Incredible. Reading this felt exactly like reading *The DevOps Handbook* for the first time. What I love about BVSSH is that there are no buzzwords to get confused about: this is simply solid advice that every organization should follow.

Read [the notes I wrote](/books/sooner-safer-happier.pdf) from this book.
