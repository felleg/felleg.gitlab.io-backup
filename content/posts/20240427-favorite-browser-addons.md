My favorite browser is Mozilla Firefox. In this post, I will list my favorite browser add-ons. Note that some of my recommandations are also available on other browsers such as Google Chrome. 

# Ublock Origin

I would never think of browsing the web without, by default, disabling targeted ads. We are bombarded on all sides with people trying to subliminally get us to give them slme attention and/or money. With an adblocker, you are still subject to getting influenced, but you will feel more in control. You don't have to wait 10 seconds before starting your video. It takes 2 seconds to set up an adblocker and it will defend you in the background incessantly.

# Your password manager's add-on

I have already spent a full blog post discussing password managers ([insert link to post] (/posts/...passwordmanager...)), so I won't go into full details here. I'll just say that any free password manager (and its matching browser extension) will do you much good, to avoid  security issues related to password reuse.

Everyone browsing the web should use a password manager.

For a long time, I had trouble learning from reading web pages because I couldn't highlight in then like I do in physical books. Thanks to this add-on, I can adapt my learning system to web pages, which makes it incredibly convenient.

# Reading Ruler (Firefox exclusive?)

Often used in conjunction with Highlight by Trix, the reading ruler helps guide my eyes when reading long text on a Web page. it displays a colored rectangle aligned with the height of my mouse pointer.
