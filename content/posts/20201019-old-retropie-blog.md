Before MiSTer was all the rage, I was a huge RetroPie fan. I still am, in fact! For most people interested in
retro gaming, this is the biggest bang you could get for your buck. For ~100 USD you could get a sweet setup.
The software emulation might not be as accurate as the MiSTer's, but the majority of people would not notice.
It also has the added bonus of supporting even more consoles than MiSTer, like the original PlayStation or
Nintendo 64.

The information in the blog is kind of old at this point, but I'm sharing it in case it might be of value to
you. And, who knows, I might write more about the RetroPie in the future!
