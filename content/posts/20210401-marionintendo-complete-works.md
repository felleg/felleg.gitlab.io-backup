I recently noticed that I never shared my contributions to rhythm-gaming on this blog. Granted, they are not
the biggest in the world, but they were done over a period that lasted almost a third of my life up to this
point. It's a huge part of who I am and who I used to be, and I figured there was the off-chance that one of
my readers would enjoy discovering this aspect of my past life.

That was back when I was part of a vibrant community. That was back when I was creative on a daily basis.
