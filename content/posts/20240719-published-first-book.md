I turned [a blog post from 2022](/ola) into a book.

Publishing a book has been a dream of mine ever since I knew how to
read.

This feels like a huge personal accomplishment. I am so proud of
myself.

The topic of learning anxiety is something I am passionate about. I
want more people to talk about it. I want to make learning fun again,
just like going to the gym.

I have to hold on to that idea, to that dream. But until then, I have
a book, a store page, and AAAAAAAAAAAAA I PUBLISHED A BOOK!
