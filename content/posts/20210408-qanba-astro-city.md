I'm a huge fan of gaming with arcade sticks. I feel it's easier on the hands after long periods of time. I
customized my Qanba Carbon arcade stick to be an homage to the Sega Astro City line of arcade cabinets. For a
while, it was my "dream" to go to Japan and see one in person. :smiley: Now, I feel I have my piece of arcade
history at home, and it perfectly suits my needs.
