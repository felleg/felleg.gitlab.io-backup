Now I know what you're thinking... This blog post isn't very impressive looking.
Well, I'm still quite proud of it! It is my first blog post using Hugo, a static
website generator. In the past, I would have used more common blogging tools,
such as the ubiquitus "blogger", or "wordpress". The thing you have to know
about me, however, is that I am a hipster, in every sense of the word. I love to
see what new things have to offer. When new things get too hot and popular, I
love going back to the past to see what everyone missed.

Here is how this blog post looks like to me as I am currently writing it:

Those among you with a sharp eye will probably recognize a bash shell running
vim and tmux, with a Windows XP flavor to solidify the retro feel. It's not
obvious from the screenshot, but my current operating system is Linux Mint
18.04. 

Yep, I'm one of those weirdos who use a Windows theme on their Linux
installation. Double hipster.

As a note to myself, I'll just leave this here: to write my next post, all I
have to do is type in the root of this directory
```bash
# From the root directory of the website
$ hugo new posts/MySecondPost.md
```
Everything has been set in place in order to work with the current theme. (Sorry
if that part didn't really make sense, now you know what I sound like when I
talk to myself!)

Have a good night and see you soon, dear reader.
