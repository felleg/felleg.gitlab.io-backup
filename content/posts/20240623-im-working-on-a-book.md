For as long as I can remember, I have wanted to be a writer of books.

The years passed. I realized that being a writer is a risky job if
your writings don't sell. So I tried to transform this desire of
writing into a day job. After some time, I pivoted towards wanting to
be a teacher. When I realized that being a teacher wouldn't afford me
the life that was sold to me on television, or at least not without
many years of fighting to get accepted into the good places of the
system, I opted to become a computer scientist. It wasn't my first
choice, but it felt safer.

Then Machine Learning came. Then DevOps came. And here we are.

In 2022, I have written a [blog post to discuss my learning
anxiety](https://web.archive.org/web/20220926004416/https://felixleger.com/posts/2022/08/overcoming-learning-anxiety/).
This particular text always felt different than my other entries. It
told a story that seemed bigger than myself. I felt like what I had
learned at that time was worth writing a book about, to educate people
about the nature of learning anxiety, as well as how I had worked
through mine.

Now almost two years later, I realized that this text turned out to be
my first book. I happened organically. The writing process did not
look like what I had imagined at five years old. But I now had six
chapters, an appendix, an introductions, a cover, ... and, in my
[bookshelf](/bookshelf), it *did* look like a real book!

So, what is the book about? One could say it's about how my life was
changed by folding a book in half (although that would leave much room
for interpretation).

If you are interested at all in helping get this book into the hands
of people in need, please [have a look to the full

appreciated! Here is what the placeholder cover looks like:

I don't know where this journey will take me. It's exciting to feel
like I have the opportunity to realize a dream held for over 20
years!
