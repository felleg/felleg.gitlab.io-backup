It's time to declare the winner of this year's prestigious prize: the **felixleger.com album of the year!**

Working from home since March, you can bet that I have listened to a multitude of genres of music in order to
help with the moody reality of the pandemic. At the last quarter of every year, I love to go to
progarchives.com to see what are the highest rated albums of the current year. These fellows dig deep to find
their material.

This year, I was caught by surprise by the album currently in third place ([see
list](http://www.progarchives.com/top-prog-albums.asp?ssubgenres=&syears=2020&scountries=&sminratings=0&smaxratings=0&sminavgratings=0&smaxresults=100&x=75&y=6#list),
namely [Sadako e le mille gru di carta](https://logosprog.bandcamp.com/album/sadako-e-le-mille-gru-di-carta)
from Italian band [LogoS](https://logosprog.bandcamp.com/). The album is in the Rock Progresivo Italiano (RPI)
subgenre of progressive rock, and is obviously in Italian. I have not yet read deeply into the (translated)
lyrics, but the album has a theme revolving around a true life story involving origami and a sick child that
survived the Hiroshima bombing disaster. That should be enough to grab anyone's interest.

I don't quite know how they do it, but artists in the RPI subgenre are excellent at creating ambiances that
sound out this world: but incredibly beautiful and haunting. Even in more quiet parts of the music, the energy
is always present and almost menacing. No other genre of rock makes me feel quite as invested in their quiet
parts.  After a few listens, when you learn to trust this menace (nothing bad will happen! These tensions will
get resolved, I swear!), the music just becomes an immense bed of feathers waiting for you to dive into. In
regards to *Sadako* itself, if you enjoy music from the band Camel and give it an Italian twist, it might give
you a good idea of the sound of the album.

Before listening to *Sadako*, this used to be my top 3 RPI albums:

- Zarathustra (Museo Rosenbach)
- Per un amico (Premiata Forneria Marconi)
- Maxophone (Maxophone)

I don't want to risk comparisons between past masters of the subgenre, but I can honestly say that even after
six listens, I keep getting drawn back to *Sadako*. We will have to wait and see where it places in the top 3
after many repeated listens. As for 2020, though, I won't bother waiting for December to roll around.

**Congratulations, LogoS!**

## A special mention

Before the pandemic rolled around, I was in love with Theo Katzman's [Modern Johnny Sings: Songs in the Age of
Vibe](https://theokatzman.bandcamp.com/album/modern-johnny-sings-songs-in-the-age-of-vibe), so much so that I
had bought tickets to see him play the album in person. I'm saddened that covid had other plans, but I still
want to give my appreciate to Theo Katzman for creating such a rich album.

# A playlist of songs I aggregated during the year

During the beginning of the year, I started accumulating "modern psychedelic-pop" songs in a playlist I called
"Soar with me". If you like this genre (think Beatles-like, but more indie with a modern twist), give this playlist a
listen!  https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1iZEDzF689EY3PUDCeHtZY?si=TpuikavhSgalTeHqf7Sjkg

# My Past Albums of the Year

Since this is the first time I create a post to award a musical album, I couldn't declare a winner for any of
the past years. Here are those that I could pin down:

## 2019 - Twenty Twenty (Djo)

Believe it or not, Twenty Twenty was released in September 2019! If only 2020 was as sweet as Twenty Twenty...
The album is nothing revolutionary, but it takes many of the best ideas from the past and wraps them up in an
honest package that feels genuine and effortless. It's a *cool* album. I'm looking forward to more content
from Djo (aka Joe Keery, aka Steve from Stranger Things (!!)). I'm already tapping my feet to his new single,
*Keep Your Head Up*.

## 2018 - Darlène (Hubert Lenoir)

Talk about a national sensation! Hubert Lenoir is an artist who is younger than me (I'm not used to that) and
creates music in Quebec city, about 3 hours from where I live. His music feels both incredibly personal and
relatable. Off the stage, his personality turned off a lot of people who heard about him and his shenanigans,
but I believe we have to separate art from the artist (and I believe the artist himself has his heart at the
right place, regardless). I don't know if it qualifies as traditional progressive rock, but it is clearly rock
with a transitional nature, if not with a bit of pop on top. The sound production is absolutely crisp, too. I
like to say this album reconnected me to my inner teen.
