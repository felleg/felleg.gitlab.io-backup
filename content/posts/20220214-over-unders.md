Here is a little flower stick trick I have been practicing lately, which I named the "chained over-unders".

The over-under is a trick that is done by doing the following steps in order:
1. Launch your stick in the air, spinning "inwardly"
1. Lift your leg on the same side as the arm that launched the stick
1. Using your other arm, catch the stick from under your leg

Doing one over-under by itself it not very hard with some practice, but I noticed that trying to chain them is a real physical challenge that could count as cardio. By the end of the video, I was genuinely exhausted! :)

My personal best attempt is chaining 24 over-unders. Let me know if you beat my score!
