Reasons:
- I really connect with Lagoon (although I think the song should have
  been named "Debonair"). Feeling of lust, oscillating beetween beauty,
  fun and darkness
- "Clown" reminds me of my days at the circus
- Beautiful songs at the end that show that under multiple layers of
  "craziness", there is sensibility
- Reprised themes
- The "action" starts as soon as you hit play


Album of the year 2021: Inside ( Bo Burnham )
