It has occurred to me that after reviewing 52 books, I hadn't yet taken the
time to explain my rating scale. Indeed, at the end of every review, I
give a score that ranges from:

- 👍👍 From BEST
- 👍   ... to
- 👎   ...
- 👎👎 WORST

Let's go more in detail about what each rating generally means to me:

- **Two thumbs down** (👎👎) is something I would tell you to avoid. To me, it didn't feel worth the time investment. I haven't rated
  something this badly yet.
- **One thumb down** (👎) is a good book that, as much as I wish I could recommend it
  to someone, there is probably another book I would recommend above it.
- **One thumb up** (👍) is something I would feel safe recommending to most people.
- **Two thumbs up** (👍👍) is something I couldn't recommend enough. It deeply connected with me
  as a reader, and I think the world would be a better place if more
  people checked it out.

There is also a special rating you might see in some of my older
reviews:

- **Still thinking about it** (:thinking:), for some reason I didn't feel comfortable
  giving a rating. That usually isn't a good sign, though. 😅

I hope that clears things up!
