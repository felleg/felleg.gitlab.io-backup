It has occurred to me that after reviewing 52 books, I haven't taken the
time to explain my rating scale. Indeed, at the end of every review, I
give a score that ranges from:

```
GOOD
👍👍
👍
👎
👎👎
BAD
```

Essentially, the scale goes from -2 to 2, and skips 0. It aims to
represent the amplitude of how enthusiastically I would recommend a book
to someone if I were talking next to them.

- Two thumbs down (👎👎) is a book I would tell you to avoid at all cost. There
  is nothing worth the time investment here, for anyone. I haven't rated
  a book this badly yet.
- One thumb down (👎) is a book that, as much as I wish I could recommend it
  to someone, there is probably another book I would recommend above it.
- One thumb up (👍) is a book I would recommend to most people.
- Two thumbs up (👍👍) is a book I couldn't recommend enough. It
  probably deeply connected with me as a reader.

I hope that clears things up! :smiley:
