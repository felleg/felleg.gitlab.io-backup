It has occurred to me that after reviewing 52 books, I hadn't yet taken the
time to explain my rating scale. Indeed, at the end of every review, I
give a score that ranges from:

- 👍👍 From BEST
- 👍   ... to
- 👎   ...
- 👎👎 WORST

Essentially, the scale goes from -2 to 2, and skips 0. It aims to
represent the amplitude of how enthusiastically I would recommend a book
to someone if I were talking next to them.

Let's go more in detail about what each rating generally means to me:

- Two thumbs down (👎👎) is something I would tell you to avoid at all cost. There
  is nothing worth the time investment here, for anyone. I haven't rated
  something this badly yet.
- One thumb down (👎) is a good book that, as much as I wish I could recommend it
  to someone, there is probably another book I would recommend above it.
- One thumb up (👍) is something I would feel safe recommending to most people.
- Two thumbs up (👍👍) is something I couldn't recommend enough (probably
  past the point of diminishing returns!). It deeply connected with me
  as a reader, and I think the world would be a better place if more
  people checked it out.

I hope that clears things up! :smiley:
