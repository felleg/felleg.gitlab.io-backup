Reading books. It never gets old.

If you had the pleasure to receive formal education, you probably know how to read. This is a skill that will
follow you for the rest of your life.

Out of all the hobbies I had in my lifetime, I find that reading is both the least demanding and most
rewarding hobby of all. Really, all you need a working set of eyeballs and a brain that can parse information.
There is no notion of speed, competition. You can't really sprain your wrist by reading. You don't need a
working set of legs. You don't need friends, and you don't need an internet connection. As your body will
start decaying, you surely will have to cross out hobbies from your list, simply because your body cannot
provide the necessary requirements to partake in said hobbies. It should be no surprise, then, that the act of
reading will stay on this list until the very end.

Look, many have tried before me to summarize why reading is such a great hobby. I could never do it justice,
despite my best attempts. But you're reading this right now, so hopefully that means you're at least halfway to
having seen the light.

Sometimes I want to watch a movie for the plot. And then I remember the mountain of books that have never been
adapted into movies. If you want to get into an original plot, look no further than books.

Most of us humans read (that's part of what makes us humans!), but we don't consume our content the same way.

How do you consume your books?

# Fake cons about E-readers

Every time I have discussions about E-readers, the same "cons" come up. And to be frank, they sound to me like
excuses not to try this new medium. Let's review some of them, courtesy of [Psychology
Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/hide-and-seek/201205/should-you-get-e-reader-all-the-pros-and-cons).

## "E-readers are expensive!"

That's the first one that comes to everyone's mind, I suppose. If you buy a new E-reader, a basic model starts
at 120 CAD. I personally use a Kobo Libra H2O that retails for 200 CAD. I agree, not pocket change!

But saying E-readers are expensive is kind of missing the big picture. They are more expensive in the short
term, sure, just like a ski pass is more expensive than paying for a single ticket. If you purchase an
E-reader, the more you use it, the more you will get value out of it.

Side note, do you know how many free digital books are available out there? I'm not talking even about piracy,
I mean books with expired copyright, or free licenses. Check out [Project
Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/) for an astounding amount of free, quality eBooks.

tl;dr: If you use your E-reader to its full potential, it will pay for itself quickly.

## "I prefer the physicality of books!"

* "I prefer to flip the pages!"
* "I like the smell of ink!"
* "I like the excitement of flipping the last page!"
* "I like the sound of the pages under my fingers!"

I don't judge people who prefer the physicality of books. I get it, I used to say that kind of thing myself. I
still love to smell any book that falls on my lap. I love to distractedly flip through it like a makeshift
stress ball. I love to tap my finger on books to hear how they sound.

But at some point, I realized that books, in their essence, are not toys. They are a way to distribute
information. An old, outdated way. They don't deserve any more credit than that.

It's ok to be nostalgic about the feel of books. But it feels so much better to break free from these
shackles. As time moves on, I don't regret the feel of books. I have my notepad from work, and that's good
enough to fill all my needs of "physicality".

Too often, I feel that marketing successfully pushes the notion that to fully understand a product, you have
to own it in its physical form. Nothing could be further from the truth, and at some point we must realize as
consumers that this is just a scheme to make us spend our money on overpriced items.

## "Books are beautiful, and they can used as decoration"

Sure! Some books are actual works of art in their physicality. I will not deny it.

But let's do a reality check. How many "beautiful books" do you own that you also read? If a book is so
beautiful, wouldn't you be afraid to damage it by using it?

If the whole point of "beautiful books" is only to appreciate their presence, are they even books at this
point? In my eyes, they become a completely different object and should not be included in this conversation.

## "You can't share books on E-readers!"

Indeed, you can't share most digital books without breaking copyright law. You could share your E-reader, but
that would kind of beat the purpose of owning one. Then again, if you and your friends are ok with breaking
copyright law, sharing books on E-readers is very real.

The way I see it, sharing books on E-readers is not nonexistent. It's just different. Did you know that
Overdrive allows you to legally borrow books from your neighborhood library?

At some point, you have to ask yourself: how often do you share your own books? Is this even a use case you
should care about?

## "You can't gift books on E-readers!"

Gifts are a touchy subject. Most of us grew up in a world where gifts are physical. As if you had to feel the
gift to feel the intention behind it.

Social conventions can change. If you knew the person receiving your gift would prefer a digital copy, would
you still feel comfortable giving them a physical book that would take up space in their home?

## "Books cannot be autographed"

I'll admit, none of my physical books are autographed. I guess it's because I don't visit book fairs. Let me
pretend for a moment that I did.

If I was able to get an autograph from my favorite authors on a copy of their books, I suppose these copies
would become personal trophies. Something I can brag about, something I could sell above market value. Not
something I'd risk damaging through normal use. In other words, an autograph would change the way I use my own
book. It would stop being a book.

It's ok to collect trophies! But we're talking about promoting reading, here. Autographed books, in my mind,
do not belong in this conversation.

## "Real books evoke fond memories, unlike digital versions"

This is a criticism that caught me completely off-guard. And I think I understand what it means, but at the
same time I'm not sure I agree with what it's getting at.

I concede that every time I pick up a book I read, I am transported back to the locations, the contexts in which
I read them. I can picture the exact moment in my mind when, book in hand, I reached a certain plot point in an
interesting story.

So... what gives? Why can't the same thing happen with an E-reader?

These fond memories, are they for:

* The story?
* The object containing that story?
* The passing of time demonstrated by the object containing the story?

Whatever the real answer may be, I'm not sure it is a productive process. Material objects shouldn't matter as
much as they do in our modern society. Sometimes I feel people pretend they can wind back time by doing
something with original artifacts (i.e. holding the same object and reading the same story from many years
ago). Can this process be anything more than bittersweet?

I don't judge you if you're doing this. I have been collecting junk from my childhood for over 20 years, now.
But, as I gradually start to get rid of the objects that have become meaningless to me, I feel more free.

## "Digital books represent a potential threat to author royalties"

Yes, but only because it seems to be by design.

Let's face it. Piracy will never go away. It is a reality, good or bad.

While we are on the subject of piracy, I want to say that my stance on piracy is mostly positive. I think we
are brainwashed by corporations to view piracy as a crime, when in reality it is often the only tool consumers
have to cut through marketing BS. Digital products have a unique opportunity to let consumers try the product
before they buy it.

Digital trials are not like physical goods: you cannot damage them. If you "take them back to the store",
nobody loses.

Most digital subscriptions have a free-trial period to help you test if the product is right for you or not.
And you know what? It works. It allows consumers to buy with confidence. I'd be willing to bet consumers spend
more on a product if they were able to try it before buying it. This should be the norm.
Too often, it feels like piracy is the only way to try something before buying it. It is a tragedy, but it is
that way because publishers failed to embrace "free demos" when the Internet was young. It created a culture
of "us versus them" that will probably never go away.

But let's forget about piracy for a moment. Let's look at two of my favorite digital distributors: Steam and
Spotify. These platforms respectively distribute video games and music; two products that had people scream
"piracy will doom the market!". Except, you can't pirate games from Steam, or music from Spotify. Their DRM is
airtight. And everyone is paying their fair share. It's amazing.

The same thing could happen with books, if only the prices were right! Take a look at this pricing for *The
Subtle Art of Not Giving a F.ck*:

{{< figure src="/img/digital-book-pricing.png" caption="What a deal! Buy digital and save 15%! That's 2.22 CAD!"position="center" >}}

Saving 15% sounds like a good deal. Saving 2 dollars sounds like a rip-off, especially when it often takes
less time to pirate the book than to enter your credit card info. I think if distributors like Amazon were
really interested in stopping piracy, they would create stronger DRM like Steam and Spotify, and they would
lower their prices. It is not our responsibility as a consumer to jump through hoops.

Remember that the people who make the most money from this transaction are the publishers and distributors.
Not the authors. The system is not built with fairness in mind.

## "Not all books are available in electronic format"

More and more books are becoming available. Any book published after 2010 surely has a digital version. And as
we move forward in time, we go deeper and deeper in humanity's back catalog in order to digitize everything we
can. It's getting there, just like for movies and music.

It's already good enough, and it will only get better.

## "Digital books represent a threat to libraries and bookshops"

Ok, let's humor this argument and pretend digital books were a real threat to libraries and bookshops. Would
they start closing down, preventing us from benefiting from their services?

No! Of course not! They would simply adapt!

We have the Internet at our disposal. All the information we want could live there, digitally. Let's ignore
for a moment the weirdos that go to libraries to touch and smell their books. Pretend libraries had the power
to digitally scan all of their books, and allow you to digitally consult them legally. Wouldn't that be
priceless? Think of all the junk libraries could move or order to better offer their premium space! I am not
suggesting that libraries should throw their stuff away: they could always build underground vaults and store
their artifacts there. Any library goer would agree, it would be more useful to have more tables in any
library, rather than cram more books in a limited space.

What about bookshops? They could shrink in size and save on rent! They could still suggest you books: digital
versions! Anything is possible. They could have physical displays for digital versions. Let's be creative!

You cannot stop progress. Things around you will change. Our children will not be able to walk our footsteps,
like our ancestors were able to walk their ancestors' footsteps. Things move too fast now. It's neither good,
now bad. It is a reality.

Let's stop being scared. Let's adapt! :smile:

# Real cons about E-readers

Here are, in my opinion, the only two true cons of E-readers:

* They are battery-operated
* They cannot replace children's books or most educational textbooks.

That's it! There's no other real con.
