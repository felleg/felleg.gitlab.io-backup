Reading books. It never gets old.

If you had the pleasure to receive formal education, you probably know how to read. This is a skill that will
follow you for the rest of your life.

Out of all the hobbies I had in my lifetime, I find that reading is both the least demanding and most
rewarding hobby of all. Really, all you need a working set of eyeballs and a brain that can parse information.
There is no notion of speed, competition. You can't really sprain your wrist by reading. You don't need a
working set of legs. You don't need friends, and you don't need an internet connection. As your body will
start decaying, you surely will have to cross out hobbies from your list, simply because your body cannot
provide the necessary requirements to partake in said hobbies. It should be no surprise, then, that the act of
reading will stay on this list until the very end.

Look, many have tried before me to summarize why reading is such a great hobby. I could never do it justice,
despite my best attempts. But you're reading this right now, so hopefully that means you're at least halfway to
having seen the light.

Sometimes I want to watch a movie for the plot. And then I remember the mountain of books that have never been
adapted into movies. If you want to get into an original plot, look no further than books.

Most of us humans read (that's part of what makes us humans!), but we don't consume our content the same way.

# Fake cons about E-readers

Every time I have discussions about E-readers, the same "cons" come up. And to be frank, they sound to me like
excuses not to try this new medium. Let's review some of them, courtesy of [Psychology
Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/hide-and-seek/201205/should-you-get-e-reader-all-the-pros-and-cons).

## "E-readers are expensive!"

## "I prefer the physicality of books!"

* "I prefer to flip the pages!"
* "I like the smell of ink!"
* "I like the excitement of flipping the last page!"
* "I like the sound of the pages under my fingers!"

I don't judge people who prefer the physicality of books. I get it, I used to say that kind of thing myself. I
still love to smell any book that falls on my lap. I love to distractedly flip through it like a makeshit
stress ball. I love to tap my finger on books to hear how they sound.

But at some point, I realized that books, in their essence, are not toys. They are a way to distribute
information. An old, outdated way. They don't deserve any more credit than that.

It's ok to be nostalgic about the feel of books. But it feels so much better to break free from these
shackles. As time moves on, I don't regret the feel of books. I have my notepad from work, and that's good
enough to fill all my needs of "physicality".

## "Books are beautiful, and they can used as decoration"

Sure! Some books are actual works of art in their physicality. I will not deny it.

But let's do a reality check. How many "beautiful books" do you own that you also read? If a book is so
beautiful, wouldn't you be afraid to damage it by using it?

If the whole point of "beautiful books" is to appreciate their presence, are they even books at this point? In
my eyes, they become a completely different object and should not be included in this conversation.

## "You can't share books on E-readers!"

## "You can't gift books on E-readers!"

## "Books cannot be autographed"

## "Real books evoke fond memories, unlike digital versions"

## "Digital books represent a potential threat to author royalties"

## "Digital books represent a threat to bookshops and libraries"

## "Not all books are available in electronic format"

# Real cons about E-readers

Here are, in my opinion, the only two true cons of E-readers:

* They are battery-operated
* They cannot replace children's books or most educational textbooks.
