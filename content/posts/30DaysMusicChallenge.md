If you have no idea what the "30-day video game music challenge" is,
here is a quick introduction. I was made aware of this challenge
recently through a YouTube channel called
[GameSack](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT6LaAC9VckZYJUzutUW3PQ)
(check them out!). The challenge is as follows: for a period of 30 days,
you must come up with a video game piece of music that respects a given
theme, following this sheet:

{{<figure src="/img/30dayvideogamemusicchallenge.png" caption="(provided by GameSack)" position="center" >}}

It's no secret to the people who know me: I love video game music. I
couldn't wait the whole 30 days, instead I created an ordered list of 30
songs in one sitting. I had lots of fun solving this challenge on HARD
mode,
especially because of the
limitation that no game must be repeated over the entire list. This
made picking the *perfect* track for the *perfect* day a heartbreaking
task that becomes a game within itself. If you're curious, here were [GameSack's
picks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5838pr793v0) (Joe went out of his way to pick *really obscure* games,
if you had heard of some of these prior, congratulations!).

# Day 01: Title Screen - Title Screen (Gunstar Heroes)
Here I start things off with a bang. The explosive title screen to one of my favorite run 'n gun games of all
time: Gunstar Heroes. I was first made aware of this game thanks to the Nintendo Wii's Virtual Console. It
also introduced me to a video game developer that would also become my favorite of all time: [Treasure Co. Ltd.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_(company))

Fun fact: you cannot hear the full version of this song during the actual title screen because the demo mode
launches too early. Instead, you must head to the sound test menu if you want to hear the full piece.

# Day 02: Opening level - Kingdom of Zebulos (Rocket Knight Adventures)
In my opinion, the first level in a video game is its most important. It has to leave an impression on the
player to make sure they continue playing. If we exclude processing power and graphical capabilities from the
discussion, I think that the first level of Rocket Knight Adventures is the one that leaves the best first
impression, thanks in no small part to its amazing soundtrack.

Full disclosure, this is my favorite platformer of all time.

(Warning: audio levels in this video are unusually high)

# Day 03: 8-bit - Artificial Intelligence Bomb (8Bit Music Power Final)

There is a lot (a LOT!) of 8-bit music. Choosing just one song to represent this entire category is unfair. I
thought of using [this battle theme from Lagrange Point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr5mqrjlMl8) on the
Nintendo Famicom, which uses special audio chips to implement FM sounds usually found on 16-bit devices.
However, my pick for this category is a relatively new composition (2003) from a chiptune artist simply known
as "naruto". Not only does this song seem to push the sound capabilities of the NES hardware without using
additional sound chips, it is also just damn catchy!  Strangely enough, [this song became somewhat of a
meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/artificial-intelligence-bomb) in 2011.

The song was included in the [8BIT MUSIC POWER
FINAL](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B01MQU3LW5?tag=duc12-20&linkCode=osi&th=1&psc=1) compilation, which is
essentially a music album on a Famicom cart. I must add, this project was entirely created by fans and
released in 2017.

# Day 04: Music from a console exclusive series - Sector 1 (Power Blade)

It was extremely difficult to find music for this category. The way I understand it, the song has to be from a
video game series that is entirely represented on a single video game console. This means any successful video
game franchise is probably automatically disqualified, since great franchises usually migrate to next
generation consoles. It also disqualifies any series that were eventually ported to PC, or received a home
port from the arcade. Since we need music from a *series*, it also means the game either must have a sequel,
or be one itself.

At first, I thought about choosing music from Adventures of Lolo 3, since it is my favorite puzzle game on the
NES. However, I later found out that this was a console port of
[Eggerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eggerland) from the same developer (HAL Laboratory) on the
[MSX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSX).

After spending some time searrching through video games series lost through time, I stumbled upon this rockin'
tune from Power Blade on the NES. This game and its sequel are very sough-after by video game
collectors. Especially Power Blade 2!

# Day 05: Hub world / Overworld - Main Theme (Final Fantasy VII)

I was fortunate enough to receive a (used) PS1 for Christmas in 1999. Final Fantasy VII was the game that was
included. I was around 6 years old and all I knew at the time was the NES and the Sega Genesis.

The game felt absolutely alien. I was not used to video games relying on text (I was just learning how to
read, and had no notion of English). The music sounded so real, it felt like I was playing a "grown-up" game
(which was pretty much the case).

Fast foward a few years, and I was able to get the mechanics down to progress through the game. The overworld
map
is only accessible after roughly 5 hours of gameplay (when you know what you're doing) and completely changes
the pace of the game. To hear this airy theme as the world opens up before you is just awesome. Despite all
its flaws, Final Fantasy VII is awesome.

# Day 06: Makes me feel relaxed - Last Wave (Out Run)

Out Run is my favorite driving (not racing!) game of all time. It was released in the arcade in 1986, making
it incredibly advanced for its time. The best thing about it is that it's still totally playable today. And as
you enter your high score, you watch the sun set on some Californian boulevard (presumably) while listening to
the Last Wave. The day is over, but it was a day filled with incredible experiences.

# Day 07: Indie game - Facility (Xenocrisis)

This 16-bit game was part of a Kickstarter campaign and was released in 2019.

2019!!

The game is a top-down "twin stick" shooter along the likes of Smash T.V. or Robotron 2084. If you are a fan
of metal, prepare to headbang to this song. And if you like the song, I strongly recommend you check out the
game!

# Day 08: FPS or 3rd person shooter - Commander Deko (Sin & Punishment: Star successor)

As you might have noticed by now, I am biased towards older console games. Unfortunately for me, the FPS and
3rd person shooter categories are really under-represented on older consoles. Sure, the Nintendo 64 had many
great shooters with great music (GoldenEye, Perfect Dark), and PC gamers had no shortage of great FPS games
(Wolfenstein, Doom, Quake, Unreal Tournament, ...), but I have a hard time connecting with these games. I
can't connect with everything! :smiley:

For this category, I will go in an unexpected route and select a song from Sin & Punishment: Star Successor,
which is an on-rails shooter for the Nintendo Wii where you see your character in third-person. The game was
developed by Treasure Co. Ltd, which means heavy explosions are to be expected. It is a great action title,
surely one of the best available on the Wii.

# Day 09: Licensed game - Building Theme (Dick Tracy NES)

Dick Tracy for the NES is an objectively bad game due to its unnecessary difficulty. It's a shame, really,
because the game has a great premise, great atmosphere, great visuals, and above all, great music. This song
plays when you enter a building filled with thugs separating you from a key suspect.

{{< youtube hnZmxRBa2QE >}}

# Day 10: RPG battle - Pokey Means Business (Earthbound)

Earthbound is a game. A weird game. A quirky game. A confusing game. A wonderful game. This song plays during
the first phase of the final boss. The first few notes sound like they come straight from an 8-bit console,
which is completely strange for an 16-bit game. It's on purpose: it makes the player feel uneasy. And
suddenly, the real "groove" begins, and unleashes double drum pedals sounds like you have never heard coming
from a Nintendo game.

I love Earthbound.

# Day 11: Puzzle game - 2 Player Versus (Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine)

For Day 11, I didn't want to choose something too obvious like the Tetris theme. I wanted to choose a song
that didn't seem to belong in a puzzle game.

Dr Robotnik's is the only port of Puyo Puyo released in America. It has little to do with Dr Robotnik's
(the main villain in Sonic the Hedgehog), other than the fact he's the game's final boss. This theme plays
when you challenge your opponent in multiplayer.

Fun fact: This theme is called "VS Satan" in Puyo Puyo.
