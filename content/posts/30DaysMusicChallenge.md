If you have no idea what the "30-day video game music challenge" is,
here is a quick introduction. I was made aware of this challenge
recently through a YouTube channel called
[GameSack](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT6LaAC9VckZYJUzutUW3PQ)
(check them out!). The challenge is as follows: for a period of 30 days,
you must come up with a video game piece of music that respects a given
theme, following this sheet:

It's no secret to the people who know me: I love video game music. I
couldn't wait the whole 30 days, instead I created an ordered list of 30
songs in one sitting. I had lots of fun solving this challenge on HARD
mode,
especially because of the
limitation that no game must be repeated over the entire list. This
made picking the *perfect* track for the *perfect* day a heartbreaking
task that becomes a game within itself.
