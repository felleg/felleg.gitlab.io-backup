Here is a little challenge I have set for myself: learning the Dvorak layout. I am using it right now to type
this post and it feels incredibly weird (and slow). I will use this post to track my progress, let's see what
happens. Hopefully I will not give up too quickly, that would be embarrassing! I know I can do it.

Just for a reference, I can usually type at 100 words per minute on a qwerty layout. This is a big drop in
efficiency that will hopefully be worth it! If I can achieve this
milestone on the Dvorak layout, then it is officially mission accomplished.
