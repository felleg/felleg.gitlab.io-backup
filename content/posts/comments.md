Good news, everyone! Comments are now enabled on the blog. I'm currently using
Disqus, as it is the easiest one to install in Hugo websites by default.

If you are curious how I managed to add the comment sections, here's how:

1. Create an account at disqus.com
1. Create a website short name [here](https://disqus.com/admin/create/)
1. In your Hugo `config.toml`, add `disqusShortname = "your-shortname"`

Looking forward to interact with you, dear audience.
