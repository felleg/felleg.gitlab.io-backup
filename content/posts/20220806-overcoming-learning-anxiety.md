description: "In this post, I discuss how I overcame learning anxiety by creating a system that motivated me to read reference material and allowed me to keep these learnings alive."
---

- I purchased the 1st edition of the DevOps Handbook in 2018 after
  plowing through the Phoenix Project
- I was super stressed when changing jobs at nesto because I felt like
  my brain couldn't absorb the required information
- Because I had never finished the book, there were pieces of the
  puzzle that felt like they were always missing for me. Finishing the
  book allowed me to finally see the whole picture
- Link the devops baby, I was genuinely excited when I made this (and
  perhaps chemically inspired...)
- Describe my system: when pen I use, why, how I fold my pages, only
  read 1 book at once (keeps notes organized). Stop starting, start
  finishing.
- In my notebook, create an index, create a reference of book title
  acronyms
- Eventually, when my notebook is full, I will read it and condense it
  again in the next notebook
- The book was purchased by my company, I find it motivating to gift it
  to the office library, encouraging learning in the workplace and
  trying to be an inspiring example
- I called myself a DevOps for years without actually understanding what
  my true goal was: it was to automate organizational learning. I
  couldn't do my job properly because I, myself, was "afraid" of
  learning, because I had no system - it felt like I was doing something
  wrong, or I was not smart enough. All I needed was a method.
- I used to say that physical books had no reason to exist, but now I
  will change this stance: for books aimed at learning in the workpalce,
  paper is excellent, because you can physically annotate it, and then
  pass this book along to your co-workers. It becomes both a trophy and
  a reference tool.
- I am still having issues learning through reading webpages, that's
  because I have no methods. Reading on the computer makes me easily
  distracted, too.
- Books are not something to be afraid of. You can decide which book you
  should read. Textbooks are not meant to be used only in a classroom,
  with a professor dragging you through it. Not all textbooks feature
  exercises and homework; some can be quite fun, relaxing, menlightening
  to read, without creating headaches or feeling like a puzzles.
- Books contains answers to some questions we have. We just have to dig
  through the book to highlight them and capture them.
