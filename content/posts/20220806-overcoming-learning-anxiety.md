description: "In this post, I discuss how I overcame learning anxiety by creating a system that motivated me to read reference material and allowed me to keep these learnings alive."
---

*It has been a while since I have taken the time to sit down and write an
actual blog post (I consider my last important post to be [the hoarding
project](/posts/2021/03/selling-my-video-game-collection-the-hoarding-project/), dating from over a year ago). I feel like sharing
my learnings with the world means I levelled up as a human being, so why
don't I write blog posts more often?*

*I suppose the blog post you're about to read has been a long time in the
making. It took 3 hours to write, but it was the result of many days,
weeks, months, years of work. Today, I am sharing you one of my biggest
milestones yet: how I overcame learning anxiety. I hope this post will
have been worth the wait to you, because it certainly has been to me.
Behind the curtains, I was hard at work on building a better version of
myself.*

*In this post, my mission is to share my "light bulb" moment with you, in
the hopes that, if you are also dealing with learning anxiety, you will
be inspired to take steps towards overcoming this wall.*

# My light bulb moment

{{< figure src="/img/learning-anxiety-lightbulb.jpg" position="center" caption="" >}}

Here it is. The moment when my mind clicked and realized I had learning
anxiety. The words in this photo were written by my own hand. What I
feel is ironic is that I had to overcome learning anxiety to realize
this was precisely the problem holding me back from learning. In other
words, as I was writing "help overcome learning anxiety (<- I have
that!)", I hadn't realized that, precisely at that moment, I was mostly
healed.

Let's back up a bit to give you better context and hopefully walk you
through the steps taken to untangle this mental knot.

# Bad news and career changes

The catalyst that sent me on this whole journey was a piece of bad news
I received my current employer in mid-June this year: I was
getting a probation extension. I wasn't quite cutting it in the
workplace. I had 2 months to course-correct, otherwise I could kiss my
job goodbye. Part of the problem was the fact that I had trouble
learning new concepts and remembering important details.

It was an watershed moment. I wasn't going to waste this opportunity.

But how did I get there?

In 2017, I started working for a newly-formed startup then called
Proximity HCI (now known as [Contxtful](https://contxtful.com)). I had
just finished my Masters thesis in particle Physics and was ready to jump into the software
world ([this is something I already discussed on this blog in
2019](/posts/2019/10/why-i-shifted-from-physics-to-focus-on-software/)).

I was hired as a machine learning scientist, and chipped away at tasks
for many months, but clearly things weren't
working out. With machine learning, I was simply "not on my X", as we say in
French, meaning I wasn't in the right context to excel. As I naturally
started working towards handling the IT of the company and discovering
automated deployment pipelines, my manager said something that would
change my life.

"You know what? I think DevOps would be a good fit for you."

If you are someone with imposter syndrome, receiving this kind of
information is a mixed bag. On one hand, it finally provides an
explanation of why you were having so much difficulty accomplishing the
tasks you were given, which is a big plus. *"Of course, it all makes
sense now! I'm bad at machine learning because, deep down, I'm a DevOps!
Change my title now, please! This will fix all my problems"*, I would say
to myself. On the other hand, it places you in front of an undodgeable
question: *"What the heck is DevOps, anyway?"*

You can then imagine why, depending on the day, my imposter
syndrome simply got out of control. I was a Physicist who changed career
paths after my Masters degree (because I felt I was bad at research) to
become an ML scientist, only to realize I was even worse at that job, so
much so that my boss recommended another career change, this time into a
field I knew absolutely nothing about. I was rightfully terrified.

# The anxiety surfaces

Not wanting to waste any time, I feverishly started Googling the most
basic things, like "how to DevOps?", which led me to results
like this:

> To speed development and improve quality, development teams began
> adopting **agile software development methodologies**, which are **iterative
> rather than linear** and focus on making smaller, more frequent updates
> to the application code base. Chief among these methodologies are
> **continuous integration and continuous delivery, or CI/CD**. [...] So
> DevOps grew out of agile.
>
> (source: [IMB](https://web.archive.org/web/20220807135552/https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/devops-a-complete-guide))

I expect this quote to feel opaque to most Physicists still undergoing
their studies. At least, it felt completely impenetrable to me.

Every search result required me to do at least three other searches to
understand what sentences meant. For a while, it felt like I was
surrounded by buzzwords, with no one telling me anything. This process
lasted months, and it was not pleasant.

I felt useless. I felt ashamed. I wished I could go back in time and
learn about agile, CI/CD, and other DevOps requirements during my
studies instead of having filled my brain with equations of motion that I have
no use for. In short, I felt like I had missed the boat, and with each
passing day felt more like giving up. I was 26.

The only thing pushing me forward was the fact that my colleagues
depended on my work, as amateurish as it was. I didn't mind going down
in a big ball of fire, but I didn't want my colleagues to suffer the
fall with me. I wanted them to thrive and excel at their rightfully
chosen tasks. Ironically, I now believe this is precisely the kind of
mindset that drives the DevOps philosophy: do everything you can to
maximize the value your peers can deliver. However, I was simply too discouraged
to realize this.

In 2019, as I was going on vacation, I stumbled upon a book called *The
Phoenix Project*, which seemed really popular in the DevOps space as an
entry point into the subject matter. Being written as a novel, I thought:
"Ah! This is perfect material to read on the beach, without any pressure
to learn. This is going to be great fun."

{{< figure src="/img/phoenix-project.png" position="center" caption="" >}}

And it was! There are many reasons for this, I believe. Firstly, the book
is, of course, very well written. It wouldn't sell over 500,000 copies
if it wasn't. Secondly, and more importantly, the fact that I was open
to the material and didn't feel pressured to understand everything right
away made a key difference. Finally, and this is key, I enjoyed this
book because I read it in its entirety, and this is something I will
come back to in this post.

In 1 week, I had finished reading my first DevOps book. Woohoo! I felt like I
was ready to conquer the world. My mind was now filled with ideas I was
excited to try. In *The Phoenix Project* subtly advertised
for another book from the same author, *The DevOps Handbook*, which
supposedly contained everything you needed to know to propel your
business forward as Bill had done for Parts Unlimited in the Phoenix
Project. I felt ready for it. Bring it on!

I ordered my copy of the DevOps Handbook in 2019.

I finished it yesterday, August 6 of 2022.

For those keeping count at home, that means three years of lead time. What happened?

# Conquering *The Devops Handbook*

{{< figure src="/img/finished-devops-handbook.jpg" position="center" caption="I conquered The DevOps Handbook. Noticed the curved spine." >}}

Here it is, the DevOps Handbook. It's actually my second copy of the
book, because it took so long for me to read the first edition that in
the meantime, the second edition came out. My new employer preapproved
the purchase of the book, so I decided to benefit from the added
material.

But that doesn't really matter. What matters is how banged up my copy
is. Do you notice the curved spine? This is because my good
friend Mathieu Frenette showed me (without realizing it?) that I had been
holding books wrong my entire life. Here's the holding position that
helped me get through the DevOps Handbook:

{{< figure src="/img/how-to-hold-book.jpg" position="center" caption="My new favorite way to hold paperbacks." >}}

What difference does that make? For one, it made me realize an important
lesson: books are not valuable. It is their content that is valuable.

As a money-poor grad student, I was relatively short on cash and keeping
my old course manuals is not something I could afford to do. Thus, I
took great care of my manuals, seldom highlighting or writing in them, so
that I could sell them at a higher price later on.

But this way of thinking is fundamentally flawed. To make an extra $40
per book sold, I was taking the risk of having a sub-optimized learning
experience.  Without realizing it, I always saw my books as someone
else's items that I was borrowing.  This was so wrong. As a student,
I depriving myself of potentially useful learning tools. Like a
mechanic afraid to break a wrench. Maybe I did this naturally since I
was used to owning collectible items (see [how and why I got rid of my
video game
collection](/posts/2021/03/selling-my-video-game-collection-the-hoarding-project/)).
I'm glad I got through my studies despite this backwards mindset, but I
don't plan on ever doing this again.

Now, my mindset is different. A broken book is beautiful. It means
someone gave it the time it deserved. And, indirectly, if this broken
book is freely available on a bookshelf in the workplace, it means that this person
understood the book enough to part with it, and thought it was worth
sharing with others.

A curved spine looks like a smile, and that might just be no
coincidence! :smiley:

# Creating a system of learning

Ok, so I knew how to hold a paperback book. Big whoop. This didn't
change the fact that after reading 10 pages, I still felt like my brain
couldn't contain all the information I was reading through. If 10 pages
of info coming in meant 10 pages of info coming out, that does not count
as learning. That is the equivalent of passively listening to radio
while driving. All your mind really records are the ads.

This time, something was different though. Folding my paperback opened
Pandora's box. Now that I was unafraid to hurt the resell value of my book,
a world of possibilities became accessible.

## Attempt 1: Margin notes

I began by writing notes in the margin that I felt would make it easier
to understand at a glance what a page was about. The reasoning was that
whenever I pulled the book from my shelf, I would quickly find
information as I flipped through the pages.

{{< figure src="/img/margin-notes.jpg" position="center" caption="" >}}

Unfortunately, that did not work. Why? Simply because I never took the
time to go back to chapters I had already read. And this was
supported by something my partner Gabrielle told me, as she was
completing her PhD: "You never want to read the same book twice". As a
fan of novels, this was something I initially disagreed with. However, I
came to understand what her statement meant: reading a book twice is
suboptimal and a potential waste of time. In other words, learn things
right on the first run-through!

## Attempt 2: Highlighting

{{< figure src="/img/highlighting.jpg" position="center" caption="" >}}

Armed with a highlighter, I had an idea: if a book is a goldmine of
information, my highlighter will allow me to illustrate where the actual
gold nuggets are.

Indeed, not every word in a book is going to be useful information to
*you*. It is up to you to determine what information is worth going back
to or not.

However, once again, I faced a problem: what good was it to highlight in
a book if that meant I had to keep going back to the book to find these
nuggets, or worse, re-understand the context in which that nugget made
sense? Again, I could hear Gabrielle's wise statement in the back of my
mind: "You never want to read the same book twice."

## Attempt 3: Record knowledge in a journal

After feeling like I was on the right path but struggling to find a
system that works, I started searching the internet for ideas. How do
fast learners learn? That is when I found this video from Matt Morris,
which outlined the system eerily close to my current system of learning, and which helped me
overcome my learning anxiety:

{{< youtube _WCfaGarc4U >}}

This video was life-changing.

In short, Matt's strategy is the following:

> Material needed:
> - Book
> - Journal
> - Pen
> - Highlighter
>
> While reading:
> - Look for the golden nuggets of information
> - Highlight the important bits
> - Rewrite it into your journal
> - Reread your journal, highlight important bits

The idea behind this system is simple: do the least to get the most.
Books contains answers to some questions we have. We just have to dig
through the book to highlight them and capture them. Forget the fluff.
Grinding through a book takes a lot of time, so do everything you can to
avoid doing it more than once. Capture information in a concise way that
will empower you.

Doing this sent me down an excellent path. My own learning system
naturally evolved from beginning with this basic system.

# My current learning system

{{< figure src="/img/rewriting.png" position="center" caption="" >}}

The core idea stays roughly the same at Matt Morris' strategy outlined
above. However, there are subtle details that make my method
work for me:

## Make a clear distinction between "books" and "novels"

My system only applies to books, which contain material from which I aim
to learn. They are not meant to be entertaining, unlike novels.

The Phoenix Project skirted that line brilliantly and I think that can
partly explain its incredible success. However, in most cases, before
you start reading, you should already know what system of rules will
apply by answering questions such as:

- Do you allow yourself to quit that particular book before finishing?
- Do you consider reading this book a personal project, or
  entertainment?

Personally, I read books in physical form, and novels in digital form.

I know, I know! I [used to say that physical books had no reason to
exist](/posts/2020/10/i-love-e-readers/), but now my stance has changed:
for books aimed at learning in the workplace, paper is almost
quintessential,
because you can physically annotate it, and then pass it along to
your co-workers. It becomes both a trophy and a reference tool. It makes
learning visible and tactile to everyone.

{{< figure src="/img/20220807-readlist.jpg" position="center" caption="My current reading list" >}}

## Invest in a bound journal
This is probably basic common-sense, but I'll make it explicit, just in
case. A spiral-bound Hilroy notebook
or, worse, a stitched exercise book, won't do much good here if pages
keep tearing and falling out of your journal after a few years.

Some features that I personally look for when buying a journal:
- A5 size - not too big, not too small.
- comes with stickers for the spine and cover to easily identify in my
  library
- contains spaces to write personal information (if lost)
- contains a table of content
- contains numbered pages

I currently write my notes in a TRURED notebook I found at Staples
(Bureau en Gros) which cost me $10. It was the cheapest dotted bound
journal in the store.

I also bought a Leuchtturm 1917 A5 to use
as a personal diary and I liked its features, feel, and available
colors, so I think the Leuchtturm will be my notebook of choice going forward.
Moleskin gear seems slightly overpriced, but I admit I have not
tried it myself.

{{< figure src="/img/use-bound-journals.png" position="center" caption="" >}}

Note: Some people enjoy spiral-bound notebooks because they allow to
easily fold back the notebook and stay opened flat on a table. If you do
invest in a spiral-notebook, at least make sure it is high quality.


## Use a grid or dotted journal

This allows better horizontal alignment of information for writing
lists. It makes my messy handwriting look less messy. Personally, I am
now very fond of dotted journals, because they provide the benefits of a
grid without being as visually distracting.

{{< figure src="/img/dotted-journal.jpg" position="center" caption="" >}}

## Take the time to shop for pens and highlighters

Story time, as this is a subject that is near and dear to my heart.

I bought my first pen in 2022 at 29 years old. Maybe it's me who's
weird, but for the longest time I did not care about the writing
material I used. I was perfectly content with whatever pen I'd find on
the ground or have had lent/given to me, either by a friend or my workplace.

What I didn't realize is that there is no one-size-fits-all pen. What
works for you might not work for me, and vice versa.

For example, the first pen I bought this year was a Pilot G-2 07. It was
definitely a step up from any previous pen I had previously used:
- Clicky button
- Deep dark ink
- Effortless glide

But it also had cons:
- Empties quickly
- Smears!!

{{< figure src="/img/smear.jpg" position="center" caption="Smears! I hate smears!" >}}

Being left-handed definitely didn't help with smears. Thus, the search
for my pen of choice began, a pen that, no matter what type of paper I
chose, without let me down, and would not smear.

Online searches seemed to center on three candidates:
- Pilot G-2 07 (which I already knew was not for me)
- Paper Mate InkJoy
- Bic Cristal

I went to my local pharmacy and saw bags of Paper Mate InkJoys and Bic
Cristals, similarly priced at 10 pens for $3. "Screw it", I said, and I
bought both. That is the best $6 investment I have ever made.

I proceeded to write an entry in my personal diary to test the pens. And
after a couple pages, the results were in: the Bic Cristal ticked all the
boxes for me. Although its ink was paler than I would have liked, it
was easy to push on paper, had a comfortable hexagonal barrel, and most
importantly, **did not smear**.

Amusingly, the Bic Cristal is the most cheaply priced pen out of all the
options I tried. The best tools are not necessarily going to be the most expensive, but you will
never find the right tool for you unless you go out, search different
options and compare them yourself. Don't cheap out on
this step - these are your learning tools. Invest the time required to
find the pen and highlighter that makes writing a joyful experience for
you.

Thus, if you're looking for recommendations, mine are:
- Pen: Bic Cristal (black or blue)
- Highlighter: Bic Brite-liner Grip

{{< figure src="/img/bic-cristal-and-brite-liner.jpg" position="center" caption="" >}}

Note: This process led me to learn about the history of the ballpoint
pen, which was a fascinating read.

Note 2: Interestingly, for drawing on human skin, the Paper Mate InkJoy
is surprisingly hard to beat. I will not be answering questions.

## Have a ruler handy

This allows you to make nice lines, for tables or underlines. Any cheap
15 cm ruler will do. It makes your journal more pleasing to read, which
is important. After all, the whole point of keeping a journal is so you
can easily refer to your knowledge.

{{< figure src="/img/ruler.jpg" position="center" caption="" >}}

## Track progress by folding the corners of the book you're reading

I vaguely remember coming across an online debate about using bookmarks
vs. folding corners. I'm clearly a folded corners guy.

Because each page has two corners, I use this to my full advantage. The
top corner indicates my reading progress, and the bottom corner
indicates my note-taking progress.

{{< figure src="/img/folded-corners-system.png" position="center" caption="" >}}

I can't overstate how useful this is. It make it feel like no moment
spent reading or taking notes is wasted. Whenever something else needs
my attention, I simply fold the corner, fully aware that whenever I'll
come back to the book, I will know exactly what I was up to. Simply put,
it reduces my cognitive load to a minimum.

I also like the fact that this transforms the act of learning
into two distinct activities:
- reading
- writing

If I'm in the mood for reading, I read. If I'm in the mood for writing,
I write. I feel like I am free to choose what activity is right for what
time. And, most importantly, whatever I end up choosing, I am constantly
learning.

## Write the source of your information nugget

{{< figure src="/img/notes.jpg" position="center" caption="" >}}

Notice in the photo above that most "knowledge nugget" ends with a
reference to the source material. This helps finding context or
correcting notes in the rare cases where your notes are unclear and you
must refer to the book. Trust me, in the worst case, it saves you a lot
of time, and in the best case, it makes sharing that nugget in the
future even easier ("As the DevOps Handbook says on page 49, improvement
of daily work is even more important than daily work!").

## Have a book reference at the beginning of your notebook

As you add more and more knowledge nuggets and references in your
journal, it is going to be helpful to know at a glance from which books
your nuggets were captured. I solve this by providing a list of books I
read at the beginning of my journals. This is also useful to remember
what the acronyms I use to reference a knowledge nugget stand for.

{{< figure src="/img/book-reference.jpg" position="center" caption="" >}}

## Leave some gaps when you feel you could come back to add details

I try to always leave roughly two empty lines around each knowledge
nugget in case I ever need to come back and add corrections or related
ideas/references. (See [photo above](/img/notes.jpg))

## Have an index in your journal

Eventually, reading your journal will take as long as reading a real
book. You will quickly begin to face the same problems that real books
had to solve ages ago. For example: in my journal, I give information
about blameless postmortems in 3 different places. That was unavoidable:
how could I plan that the book would have nuggets about postmortems in
different sections and chapters?

Having an index allows me to easily retrieve information in my journal.
Of course, this requires that you number your pages, but it's a
trade-off I could not imagine myself living without.

It just makes sense, you know?

{{< figure src="/img/book-index.jpg" position="center" caption="" >}}

## Read a single book at a time

As you start learning, you get excited when you see all the
possibilities within your grasp. Never forget "Stop starting, start
finishing".

{{< figure src="/img/stop-starting-start-finishing.jpg" position="center" caption="Words to live by." >}}


Choose your book well, and don't start another one before you finished
your current one. Use this as motivation to get through your current
book, if needed!

Personally, leaving a book without finishing it only makes me more
confused. It gives me pieces of the puzzle, but since I lack pieces I
will never see that puzzle to completion. Bite the bullet, and finish
the books you start, unless they are novels that fail to grab your
attention.

Wait until you are in the final pages of a book before ordering your
next book. You don't want to take commitments that you might not be able
to complete. I strongly advise to order only a single book at a time -
don't get carried away!

{{< figure src="/img/continuous-delivery.jpg" position="center" caption="This is the next book I'm tackling. It has been on my radar for years. I finally feel ready to give it an honest try." >}}

Note: Reading a Go book on the side is ok, although I recommend
reading a single Go book at a time. :smile:

## Sharing the learning material

This is the fun part. When you finished reading a book and collecting
all its nuggets in your journal, you are free to share it with the
world. In fact, I think it's better to bring the book out of your home
and find it a new home where it will be happy. In my case, since my
employer provides me a personal wellness account that funds my book
purchases, I think it's a no-brainer to bring these books back to the
office, where I know they will benefit my colleagues.

Writing the Slack message announcing the newly available book in the
library is the victory lap.

{{< figure src="/img/book-sharing.png" position="center" caption="" >}}

For the DevOps Handbook, since this book meant a lot for me during my
personal development, I added a little note on the title page:

{{< figure src="/img/encouraging-others.jpg" position="center" caption="" >}}

## In your next journal, transfer best nuggets from the previous one

Always in a effort to make information accessible, what I plan on doing
when I fill my current journal and inevitably have to get a new one, is
to transfer my favorite nuggets to the new journal. That way, I won't
have to constantly switch between journals.

This goes in line with the "single source of truth" principle found in
the DevOps mentality. Information is only useful if it is first accessible!

Also, if you have access to a digital scanner, I strongly recommend that
you scan the entire content of your finished journal for preservation.
You wouldn't want a dumb water leak to ruin all your hard work!

# Conclusion

I find this image very telling. My learning system allowed me to
compress a 421-page book down to its essential learning nuggets, which
take only 50 pages in my A5-sized journal. This means I will get as much
information from reading these 50 pages than from reading 421 pages.

{{< figure src="/img/compressed-book.jpg" position="center" caption="50 pages of pure nuggets!" >}}

Instead of taking weeks to read, it will take me 1 hour. This feels
almost like cheating, except it isn't! I worked hard for this outcome,
and now I get to savour it.

Books are not something to be afraid of. Not anymore. I realized I now
get to decide which book I read. As a professional, I am the master of my own
learning. Textbooks are not meant to be used only in a classroom, with a
professor dragging you through it. Not all textbooks feature exercises
and homework; some can be quite fun, relaxing, enlightening to read,
without creating headaches or feeling like a puzzles. The book you chose
almost certainly contains the answer to the question that made you
choose it. Imagine how you will feel when you finally get the answer you
craved!

**Learning is not a skill. We are all lifelong learners.** What allows some
people to learn faster than others is that they have created and
optimized a learning system that is suited around their way of learning.
When I realized that the core mission of DevOps is to create a system that
automates organizational learning, I felt the pinch of irony, because to
realize this, I had to create my own system of learning. Now that this
is done, I feel more empowered than ever and ready to take this
challenge head-on.

As a child who wanted to become a teacher for most of his life, I can't
be more satisfied with my current career choice: teaching businesses how
to learn. I have no idea what I did to deserve this great luck, even
though it was far from a painless experience to get here.

If you personally suffer with learning anxiety and made it this far in
this blog post, I'm confident that you are already on the right path. I
hope the ideas I have outlined will inspire you to find your own system
and rediscover the simple, sacred joy of learning. There are still
challenges ahead, and there always will be. For example, I am still
having issues learning through reading webpages, even accounting for
distractions. That suggests there is another system that I will inevitably have to
adopt eventually. I've done it once, so I trust I can do it again and,
hopefully, in less time than it initially took me (3 years)!

After all, that's what learning is all about! :wink:
