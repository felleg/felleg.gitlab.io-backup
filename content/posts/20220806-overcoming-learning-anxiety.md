# Preface

We who suffer from learning anxiety suffer in silence, without realizing
it. We know where to get information, but we do not feel capable of
using it effectively. We feel powerless, stupid, and out of place. What
is wrong with us? Why are we so *broken*?

We don't hear many people talk about learning anxiety, and I believe
therein lies the issue. Mental healing requires acknowledgement, and
acknowledgement requires knowledge of the problem. The anxious learner
is less likely to learn about their condition, because the idea of
learning feels unsafe to them in the first place. It is a sadly ironic
condition.

I have suffered from learning anxiety for the majority of my life and I
was oblivious to it. Being anxious about learning made me afraid of
failure, which in turn hindered my natural development. Luckily, I have
made significant strides in my journey towards healing this condition
when I turned 28 years old. Now in my thirties, I confidently say that overcoming
my learning anxiety gave me a second chance at life. I believe it is my
duty to share my story and what I *learned* from it, in the hope that
this text reaches someone in need (you?).

If there's only one thing I'd want you to remember from this text, it's
that **anyone can experience learning anxiety and solving it requires a
system of your own creation that will make learning a joyful experience
to you**. In this text, I will tell you my story: how I discovered I had
learning anxiety, the impact it had on my life, and the techniques I
developed to work through it. If you experience learning anxiety, my
hope is that this text will make you realize that you are not alone and
that there is a way out. You can overcome any obstacle that stands in your way, and you can even have fun
while doing it. All it takes is the willingness to fail and learn from
our mistakes. And, perhaps, the urge to read a book or two. Or {{< n_books >}}.

I hope this text will bring value to your life.

P.S. Don't feel bad if you don't finish reading this text in its
entirety. Perhaps I didn't make it engaging enough, or too rambly. You
have full permission to blame the author if you lose interest. :slightly_smiling_face: If I may
ask a small favor in return, just post a comment at the bottom of this
page to let me know how far you made it, so that I have an idea of which
section needs improving. Thank you for your help!

# Introduction: Discovering I had learning anxiety

> *There are two kinds of anxiety associated with learning: “learning
> anxiety” and “survival anxiety.” Learning anxiety comes from being
> afraid to try something new for fear that it will be too difficult,
> that we will look stupid in the attempt, or that we will have to part
> from old habits that have worked for us in the past. **Learning
> something new can cast us as the deviant in the groups we belong to.**
> It can threaten our self-esteem and, in extreme cases, even our
> identity.*
>
> *You can’t talk people out of their learning anxieties; they’re the
> basis for resistance to change. And given the intensity of those
> fears, none of us would ever try something new unless we experienced
> the second form of anxiety, survival anxiety—the horrible realization
> that in order to make it, you’re going to have to change. Like
> prisoners of war, potential learners experience so much hopelessness
> through survival anxiety that eventually they become open to the
> possibility of learning. But even this dejection is not necessarily
> enough. Individuals can remain in a state of despair permanently.*
>
> *How can leaders help their followers maximize their learning while
> minimizing their pain?*

> (Diane Coutu, [The Anxiety of
Learning](https://hbr.org/2002/03/the-anxiety-of-learning))

I wasn't always aware of how bad my learning anxiety was, and I'm
convinced that most people who suffer that condition don't realize it
either.

I knew I felt
bad about my performance at work. I had felt that for a long time, but I couldn't
quite put my finger on why. It's not that I wasn't trying hard enough: in
fact, I felt I was trying so hard that I was getting close to burning
out. However, I also felt like I wasn't accomplishing as much as I should
have, considering the amount of energy I was pouring daily into my work. From
the outside, it might have looked like this:

{{< figure src="/img/too-busy.jpeg" position="center" caption="''Just get off your bike for a second!''" >}}

A series of events eventually put me in
survival mode, where I had two possible outcomes:

- learn to adapt...
- ... or learn to let go.

This led me to read a certain DevOps  handbook, which led me to write
down these words:

{{< figure src="/img/learning-anxiety-lightbulb.jpg" position="center" caption="A photo of my notes: ''In the team, we want to help overcome learning anxiety.''" >}}

Well, here it is. This is the moment when my mind clicked and realized *I* had learning
anxiety. Before writing it down and seeing it with my own eyes for the first time --- "learning
anxiety" --- I had never heard of that concept before. It was completely alien to me. While it did
make logical sense and described accurately how I felt, how could I claim to have learning anxiety if I had
a Masters in Physics? Clearly, I had above average learning abilities,
right? I felt like I had no excuse to feel the way I was feeling.

But it was true. Regardless of my past achievements, I simply had plain old learning anxiety.

I certainly knew how I felt when it
came to learning: to put it mildly, I felt my learning performance was
below that of all those around me.

It seems ironic to me that I had to overcome my learning anxiety in
order to
learn that this was exactly the problem holding me back. In
other words, precisely as I was writing *"learning anxiety (<- **I
have that!**)"*, I was beginning to heal, although I hadn't realized it. Very meta...

Let's start untangling this mental knot by going back in time.

# Chapter 1: The anxiety begins

In 2017, fresh out of University and ready to tackle the world, I
started working for a newly-formed startup then-called Proximity HCI
(now known as [Contxtful](https://contxtful.com)). I had just finished
my Masters thesis in particle Physics and was ready to jump into the
software world ([this is something I already discussed on my blog in
2019](/posts/2019/10/why-i-shifted-from-physics-to-focus-on-software/)).

I was hired as a machine learning scientist, and chipped away at tasks
for many months, but things were clearly not
working out. With machine learning, I was simply "not on my X", as we say in
French, meaning I wasn't in the right context to excel. As I naturally
started working towards handling the IT of the company and discovering
automated deployment pipelines, my then-manager (and trusted friend!) Alexandre Desilets-Benoit said something that would
change my life.

*"You know what? I think DevOps would be a good fit for you."*

For  someone with a self-diagnosed impostor syndrome, receiving this kind of
information is a mixed bag. On one hand, it finally
explained why I was  having such a difficult time  accomplishing the
tasks I was given. This  was a relief. *"Of course, it all makes
sense now! I'm bad at machine learning because, deep down, I'm a DevOps!
Yes, change my title now, please! This will fix all my problems"*, I would say
to myself on my little cloud of joy. On the other hand, I now
faced an undodgeable
question: *"What the heck is DevOps, anyway?"*

You can  probably imagine why, depending on the day, my impostor
syndrome simply got out of control. I started as a humble Physicist. I changed career
paths after my Masters degree to
become a Machine Learning scientist (out of nowhere), only to realize I was even worse at that job, so
much so that my boss recommended another career change, this time into a
field I knew absolutely nothing about. I was rightfully terrified.

Not wanting to waste any time, I feverishly started Googling the most
basic things, like "How to DevOps?" and "What is DevOps?". To give you an idea of the steepness of the
learning curve I was faced with, check out [this great video from TechWorld
with Nina](https://youtu.be/9pZ2xmsSDdo?si=UHPLsU2gar5CNhCZ) and count how
many times something along the lines of "you need to learn / know /
understand" is said:

{{< youtube 9pZ2xmsSDdo >}}

(I counted over 30 occurrences.)

Every search result required me to do at least three other searches to
understand what basic sentences meant. For a while, it felt like I was
surrounded by buzzwords, with no clear explanations in sight. Oh how I wished Jimmy Neutron's "[book gum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1ambhfSnBA)" was real!

This process
lasted *years*, and it was unpleasant. I felt useless. I felt ashamed. I wished I could go back in time and
learn about agile, CI/CD, and other DevOps requirements during my
studies instead of having filled my brain with equations of motion that I had
no use for. In short, at 27 years old, I already felt like I had missed the boat, and with each
passing day felt more like giving up.

The only thing pushing me forward was the fact that my colleagues
depended on my work, as amateurish as it was. I could entertain the idea
of going down
in a big ball of fire, but I didn't want my colleagues to suffer the
fall with me. I wanted them to thrive and excel at their respective
tasks. Ironically, I now believe this is precisely the kind of
mindset that drives the DevOps philosophy: Do everything you can to
maximize the value your peers can deliver. However, I was simply too discouraged
at the time to realize this...

In 2019, as I was going on vacation, I stumbled upon a book called *[The
Phoenix
Project](/reads/read-41-1-the-phoenix-project/)*, which seemed really popular in the DevOps space as an
entry point into the subject matter. Being written as a novel, I thought:
"Ah! This is perfect material to read on the beach, without any pressure
to learn. This is going to be great fun."

{{< figure src="/img/phoenix-project.png" position="center" caption="Buy, buy, buy! That's the easy part." >}}

Turns out, it was great fun indeed! There are many reasons for this, I believe. Firstly, the book
is, of course, very well written. It wouldn't sell over 500,000 copies
if it wasn't. Secondly, and more importantly, the fact that I was open
to the material and didn't feel pressured to understand everything right
away made a big difference. Finally, and this is key, I enjoyed this
book because I read it in its entirety. This is something I will
come back to later in this post.

In a single week, I had finished reading my first DevOps book. Woohoo! I felt like I
was ready to conquer the world. My mind was now filled with ideas I was
excited to try out. *The Phoenix Project* subtly advertised
for another book from the same author, *[The DevOps
Handbook](https://amzn.to/4clZUMF)*, which
supposedly contained everything you needed to know to propel your
business forward like the protagonist of *The Phoenix
Project*. I felt ready for it. Bring it on!


# Chapter 2: *The DevOps Handbook*

I ordered my copy of *[The DevOps Handbook](https://amzn.to/4clZUMF)* in 2019. I finished it on August 6, 2022. For those keeping count, that means three years of lead time. What happened?

The [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) is what happened. I had reached the peak of Mount Stupid. Some people call this "premature enlightenment." My confidence in my ability to learn from reading had risen above my actual abilities.

{{< figure src="/img/dunning-kruger-effect.png" position="center" caption="The path to mastery of any type involves traversing the Dunning-Kruger graph from left to right." >}}

After only a few chapters, I began to feel dizzy. This
book wasn't like the Phoenix Project. It was a _real_ book, one that
required actual effort to read through. It laid the truth bare: I had no idea what I had gotten myself into. I quickly fell into the Valley of Despair. 

Every new information felt like it took
the place of another one in my head, reminiscent of a musical chair of knowledge.
For example, I had trouble remembering what the [Three Ways of
DevOps](https://itrevolution.com/articles/the-three-ways-principles-underpinning-devops/) stood for, even though they were central parts of both the
Phoenix Project and the handbook. It felt like I was drowning in
information. If the Phoenix Project
managed to organically sneak in   a reasonable amount of information within the context  of  the story, the *DevOps Handbook* proved to be too much for me. There seemed to be no time for relaxation: The handbook  simply lined the knowledge nuggets one after the other relentlessly.

Very early on, I could feel my reading velocity diminish as I was
reading my physical copy. I took a stab at the digital version on my Kobo to see if that could help (I was
very big on e-readers at the time, see [I Love
E-readers](https://felixleger.com/posts/2020/10/i-love-e-readers/)), but I
got the same result; Initial progress
was quick, and then everything ground to a halt.

Reluctantly, I shelved  the handbook both physically and digitally, feeling ashamed and
defeated. I felt even more like an impostor: the fact I couldn't get
through the *DevOps Handbook* proved it. I was a fake DevOps.

This pattern of excitement for learning leading  to bitter
disillusionment was, as you might have guessed, not limited to the
*DevOps Handbook*.
Throughout most of my time at Contxtful, I was given the opportunity to
learn, and by my own account, failed to do so more   than I succeeded. I
was going from Mount Stupid to Mount Stupid, never making it through any
Valley of Despair.
Eventually, the feeling of being unable to reach  my full potential at
Contxtful (and potentially hurting the company as a result) led me to
quit my job and join [nesto](https://nesto.ca), in the hope that there lied the key  that would unlock my
potential. And would you believe it, each member of the DevOps team got to receive their own copy of the *DevOps Handbook*. This book was following me everywhere I went! So much time had elapsed since I started reading it that the second edition of the Handbook had now come out.

Surely there was some secret sauce at nesto that would allow me to succeed where I failed at Contxtful. What new possibilities would allow me to escape the Valley of Despair? 

The answer came quickly: for the first time in my life, I was threatened with termination.


# Chapter 3: Good fold, Bad fold

In June 2022, three months after joining the nesto DevOps team, I
received the unfortunate news: I was getting a probation extension. I
wasn't quite cutting it in the workplace. I had trouble learning the new
tools and processes required to become a productive teammate. New
concepts and important details eluded me. To summarize, I was failing,
and hard. If I didn't manage to course-correct within two months, I
could kiss my job goodbye.

This is what put me into **survival mode**, where the hopelessness of
the situation was such that it finally made me open to learning.

To be told by a manager that I was not pulling my own weight was a first
for me. I wasn't going to waste this
opportunity to show the world what I could do when given proper
motivation.  So I got to work, big time. My focus in mid-June was higher
than ever,
thanks to survival instincts that kicked into high gear. One of my first
personal goals was to get through the *DevOps Handbook* before the end of
my extended probation, partly to prove to myself that I could
accomplish something for once.

Two months later, after over three years of trying, I turned the last
page of *The DevOps Handbook*. Something had changed within me. I had learned *how to
read a book*.

{{< figure src="/img/finished-devops-handbook.jpg" position="center" caption="DONE!" >}}

Can you  spot it? The little detail that allowed me to finish the book?

Look at the spine. Do you notice how curved it is? Isn't that simply wonderful? It reminds me of a well-loved punching bag.

I guess I must explain. See, I have developed a very recent fondness for
curved spines (at least, on books). I used to think having a book with a
curved spine meant you weren't taking care of your stuff. I equated curved spines to negligence.
Today, I realize there are good folds, and there
are bad folds. A bad fold is the kind of fold I described above:
actual damage. The picture above is an example of a good fold: it is
evidence left by someone who really put their energy into
extracting everything there was to learn from a specific book, page
after page. It's a
subtle difference, but it means a lot!

For example, if someone was standing in a gym next to their punching
bag, you would probably understand that whatever damage the bag exhibits
went directly into making that person stronger. If you had to fight someone, you'd probably pick the boxer with a seemingly untouched punching
bag in their gym.

Now look at the books in your library (if you have some). What does
this say about your learning habits?

{{< figure src="/img/punching-bags.png" position="center" caption="I don't know about you, but I'd rather spar with the person who practiced with the bag on the left." >}}

It was my then manager (and mentor!)
Mathieu Frenette who showed me a "tool" that I
would be using for the rest of my life. It is a
way of holding books that reminds us that **our goal is to learn**. I call it the book suplex, but I also give it other fun names like the inverse fold, or the broken spine grab. Here is what it looks like:

{{< figure src="/img/book-suplex.jpg" position="center" caption="Suplex that book, even if it's a hardcover!" >}}

Some people might cringe when seeing this. Are you one of those? :wink:

Yet, those who know, know. For me, this opened Pandora's box.
Now, you might be asking: What difference does it make to hold a book
bent over backwards?

- It's more comfortable for long periods of time
- It's less distracting (because you see only one page at a time)
- It leaves a mark (books are punching bags!)

A book is just a bunch of pages with ink on them. It is a book's content that is valuable, i.e. what sticks in your brain after  you are done with it.  The extraction process might leave marks, but  that is secondary.
Books are a mere tactile visual support. We have to stop "respecting"
our books. A suplexed book is not impacted
at all in its capacity to teach us something. Yet, as obvious as this
might sound, it is a truth that eluded me for many years.

## Flashback

About 10 years ago, I was a relatively money-poor grad student. I was somewhat short on cash and keeping
my old course textbooks was not something I could afford to do. Thus, I
took great care of these textbooks, seldom highlighting or writing in them, in order to boost their eventual sale price.

Unfortunately, this strategy was sub-optimal. For  an extra $40
per book sold, I was taking the risk of having a lesser learning
experience.  Without realizing it, I always saw my books as someone
else's items that I was borrowing, or some item that might become
desirable in the future, like Pokémon trading cards.  This was so wrong. As a student, I
was depriving myself of potentially useful learning tools in fear of
wasting resources (money). I was like a
boxer who was afraid  to damage his punching bag. Maybe I had this mindset
since I was used to owning collectible items (see [how and why I got rid
of my video game
collection](/posts/2021/03/selling-my-video-game-collection-the-hoarding-project/)).
Whatever the reason, I'm glad I made it this far in  life  despite this backwards mindset, because I
don't plan on doing this ever again.

(End flashback)

So there you have it. Now you know why I believe a folded book is beautiful. It means
someone probably gave the book the time and energy it deserved. And, indirectly, if this "damaged"
book is freely available on a bookshelf near you, it means that person
understood the book enough to part with it, and thought it was worth
sharing with others.

Is it really a coincidence that a curved book spine looks like a smile?
:smiley:

# Chapter 4: Creating a system of learning

So, I knew how to hold a book. Big whoop. This didn't
change the fact that after reading 10 pages, I
couldn't contain all the information I was reading. If 10 pages
of info coming in my brain means 10 pages of info coming out, that does not count
as learning. That is the equivalent of passively listening to radio
while driving. All your mind really records is the ads.

This time, something was different though. Folding my paperback opened
Pandora's box. Now that I was unafraid to hurt the resell value of my books,
a world of possibilities became accessible.

Many attempts were made before stumbling upon my learning system. We
learn by doing. At first, I tried to take notes in the book using a pen.
While it felt great to do in the moment, it didn't have any lasting
effect. I then tried to do the same thing with a yellow highlighter, as
I had heard in primary school that the color yellow makes it easier to
remember things. That was baloney. The problem in both cases is that
having to flip through tens of pages just to view my notes was
inconvenient. While it felt good to interact with the words on the
pages, it didn't help me remember anything! It was at that moment that
my partner Gabrielle said something very wise:

> You should never have to read a book or textbook more than once. If you take good notes, once you finish a book, you can consider yourself done with it.

She was so right about that. This gave me a new motivation: whatever
system I'd use for learning, it would be a system that doesn't depend on
maintaining access to the source material. In fact, after she told me
this, I realized the best course of action was to give the book away
once I am done reading it. It is the simplest, cleanest and safest
way to ensure my learning system is working.

I didn't have to search for very long after that insight to have my eureka
moment. Armed with the rule of giving my book once I'm done reading it,
I started searching for ideas online that would cement my learning
system. [This video from
Matt Morris titled How to Read a Book for Maximum Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WCfaGarc4U) fit the bill.

What I want you to remember from this chapter is that my learning system
didn't just fall on me from the heavens. I failed a bunch of times
before stumbling upon a process that worked! I asked my partner for help
and suggestions when I realized I was out of ideas. I searched on
YouTube for insight. I was at my most vulnerable then, because I was
basically admitting that I needed help. I had overcome the
learning anxiety on the topic of learning itself. It might not look like
much, just asking someone or a search engine for help, but this is huge!
It requires tremendous courage to try new things,
fall on your face, and ask for help. I tip my hat to anyone who
experiences learning anxiety and makes it this far in their own journey.
This is the stuff psychological breakthroughs are made of.

I can't say if your learning system will look like mine. But however
your brain learns, you'll have to fail before you get good. So remember
that **each humbling failure is a step closer to mastery, and rejoice that you are
making real progress.**

# Chapter 5: My current learning system

Here's how the sausage is made, in three easy steps. You will need:

- Notebook
- Pen
- Highlighter
- Ruler

Make sure that each of these items are objects that you personally enjoy
using. I'll nerd out [in a later section of the Appendix about the hardware I
use](#additional-tips-on-hardware), but for now just focus on making sure
that whatever gear you end up choosing makes you want to read/write
more, not less!

## Step 1: Read and highlight the golden nuggets

Crack open the book with a highlighter in hand and highlight whatever
golden nuggets of information *you* find interesting. Whenever I
highlight something, I don't care if this is something the author
expected me to memorize or not, resonate with or not. Often times I even take
pride in highlighting a little detail that feels irrelevant in the
scope of the whole book but that *I* connect with. Do not be scared by
this freedom: follow your instinct.

As you read, don't bother trying to remember everything. Personally, when I turn a
page, I feel completely OK not remembering what I just read! Read
your book like you're watching a TV show or listening to a podcast.
Highlight as you go, and know that we will come back to collect all
these little knowledge nuggets later. :wink:

{{< figure src="/img/mining-for-golden-nuggets.jpg" position="center" caption="Highlighting = identifying the gold nuggets." >}}

## Step 2: Write down your highlights

When you're done with the book (or whenever you feel like it, really!),
get your notebook out. We will now go back to the beginning of the
book and flip page by page looking for any nugget you identified
earlier.

Why take the time to write by hand all of these nuggets? I'm glad you
asked.

Firstly,
this will make it much easier for you to focus on the *useful* content
of the book whenever you want to revisit its ideas later. Think about
it: your notes will be all the *good stuff*. No distractions. Pure gold,
selected by you!

Secondly, and in my opinion most importantly, writing a nugget forces it to get into your brain, even if only briefly. Indeed, any sentence that goes into your notebook was seen by your eye,
decoded by your brain, and crafted by your hand's muscles. For your
memory, this
process is much richer than just reading words, which only
involves the eye and the brain. By writing your highlights, you are
immersing yourself in the book. It's a hard experience to describe, as
it is both incredibly simple and profoundly powerful. I think you'll have to give it a shot to really *get* it.

Thirdly, as I wrote earlier in [Chapter
4](#chapter-4-creating-a-system-of-learning), you want to do everything
you can *not* to depend on having access to the book once you're done with
it. The goal of producing complete notes is to allow you to unshackle
from the book and claim this knowledge as your own.

In this process of going through the book a second time to collect your
nuggets, feel free to not even look at the pages without highlights. I
mean, why would you? You already read them and clearly haven't identified anything of
value there. Trust your instinct: move on! It feels good when you can
skip over a bunch of pages empty of nuggets.

{{< figure src="/img/lecture-notes-cas.jpg" position="center" caption="Writing notes = capturing knowledge nuggets" >}}

As you can see in the picture above, I don't really bother rephrasing
the quotes from the book. The only time I'll rephrase something is if I
can make it shorter, or if I find the original sentence hard to
understand. Your mileage may vary, though. Some people tell me you *have* to reword quotes you get from a book. To each their own!

Personally, I love this step of writing highlights on paper. I often do this while listening to music,
or while watching a video in the background. It's very relaxing. Just go
at your own pace and stop when you've had your fill.

## Step 3: Write about your opinion of the book

This might seem like overkill to most, but I wouldn't even think of
skipping this step. Once I'm done with a book, I want to formulate my
own opinion about what I just read in the form of a review. This is what
cements it in my brain and makes me feel like I own the ideas I'm
discussing.

Since I use my website as a platform for reviewing the books I read,
sometimes I get stage fright. "What will people think of me if I write
this and that in my review?" In a way, reviewing books also forces me to
face my fear of rejection.

In my reviews, I give myself the freedom to be as detailed or as brief
as I want. In a way, I treat a review like an artist would treat a
canvas: whatever ends up there is simply a reflection of how I felt
about the book.
Sure, I try to put a minimum of effort in my reviews, but I also try not
to overdo it.

Finally, I use my review as a final opportunity to include my *favorite*
knowledge nuggets from the book one last time. I call those :star: Star Quotes :star:. To do this, I look at the notes
I took from the book and highlight those I find worth sharing with
others. No need to overthink it: I recommend just following your
intuition once more. For example, if you are typing your review on a computer,
any quote you include at this stage will be searchable, e.g. using
Ctrl-F. Thus, when in doubt, I tend to include more quotes than
necessary, because the ability to use Ctrl-F (or `grep`, to be precise!
:wink:) to search among my quotes is incredibly convenient. To quote
[Where Good Ideas Come From](/61), "Write everything down, but keep your
folders messy!"

[Here is an example of the latest review I wrote](/82). Feel free to
copy my format if you want, or create your own. In the end, what matters
is that you create a pattern of work that forces your brain to think about these ideas and have them
make sense for you. You get bonus points if you make this review public:
not only are you sharing your knowledge, but you also encourage people
to participate in your journey and initiate discussions with you.

The format you use to review your books doesn't matterinitiate
discussions It can be a
website like me, a fresh page in your notebook, a Word document, an email, a spreadsheet, etc. As long
as you use _your_ words to write about the subject you read about, you
will do fine. The easiest it is for you to access that information once
you're done, the better.

That's it, really! However, since I am very passionate about this
subject, I can't resist sharing some additional tips. Head over to
the [Appendix](#appendix) for more precise tricks.

# Chapter 6: Conclusion

I find the image below very telling. My learning system allowed me to
compress a 421-page book down to its essential learning nuggets, which
take only 50 handwritten pages in my A5-sized journal. This means I will get as much
information from reading these 50 pages than from reading 421 pages.

{{< figure src="/img/compressed-book.jpg" position="center" caption="50 pages of pure nuggets!" >}}

Instead of taking days to review that information, it will take me 1 hour. This feels
almost like cheating, except it isn't! I worked hard for this outcome,
and now I get to savour it. Better yet, since all the crucial information is compact and written by me and for me, 
the ideas assemble in my head much quicker than if I was just reading the book all over again.

Books are not something to be afraid of. Not anymore. I realized I now
get to decide which book I read. As a professional, I am the master of my own
learning. As the DevOps Handbook rightly puts it on page 320 of its
second edition:

> **The only sustainable competitive advantage is [your] ability to learn
> faster than the competition.**
>
> -- Peter Senge 

Textbooks have a purpose outside the classroom, even if that
means you won't have a professor
dragging you through it. Not all textbooks feature exercises
and homework; some can be quite fun, relaxing, enlightening to read,
without creating headaches or feeling like puzzles. A book you chose
almost certainly contains parts of the answer to the question that made you
choose it.

Imagine how you will feel when your book shows you a new way to think
about a specific problem you couldn't quite figure out. Suddenly, a new
connection occurs in your brain. Now, all you can see is the answer.
Everything simply  makes  sense! Personally, this is among the most
powerful and freeing experiences I have felt yet. It truly is a
transcending moment that cannot be overstated.

**We are all lifelong learners.** If you want to learn about something, you can do it. What allows some
people to learn faster than others is that they have created and
optimized a learning system that is suited for *their* way of learning.
When I realized that the core mission of DevOps, which eluded me for years, is to create a system that
automates organizational learning, I felt the pinch of irony since this realization had required me to create *my* own system of learning. Now that this
is done, I feel more empowered than ever and ready to take this
challenge head-on.

I don't want to give you the wrong impression: I am definitely still not
immune to learning anxiety, even after reading {{< n_books >}} books and writing all
about my experience. [Nobody gets used to feeling dumb](/69), and
unfortunately the
more you learn, the more you realize how little you actually know about
everything. The good news is that I now feel equipped to tackle this
journey. I'll never be done learning, and true learning is always an
uncomfortable, if not painful process. Nevertheless, my learning system
allowed me to come across pieces of wisdom that radically changed my
relationships and my life for the better.  I cannot even begin to express the sheer magnitude that the ability to read non-fiction books had on my life. Yet, I am *overcoming* learning anxiety. I am not done, and probably never will be. I am
*learning* that pain can be leveraged. I am *starting* to believe that the only
real failure is not to learn from failure. I am *beginning* to see fear as a compass that
guides us toward the path that will make us grow.

If you personally suffer from learning anxiety and made it this far in
this blog post, I am in awe of you. [The last mile is always the least crowded](/40), and you are among the courageous few that made it to the end. Seriously, lift your favorite arm and give yourself a pat on the back from me. I am confident that you are already on the right path: the real journey begins here, if you accept it. I
hope the ideas I have outlined above will inspire you to give them a try or, better yet, to find your own system
and rediscover the simple, sacred joy of learning. If this changes your life even half as much as it changed mine, you're in for the ride of a lifetime, my friend.

We truly can do anything we set our mind to. That is what learning is all about.

# Appendix: Additional tips

In this section, I will tell you about some tricks I picked up over years of
learning from books. If you have other interesting tricks you would like
to share, please let me know in the comments below! :pray:

## Tip 1: Grab your book before grabbing your phone

The best way to progress through a book is not to allocate
long periods of time for reading, but rather to keep your book handy at
all times and to open it briefly whenever you're between tasks.

Basically, any time you feel like picking up your phone to browse, pick
your book first, and see if you can squeeze a quick paragraph or two (or
more, if you get into it!).
You'll be amazed by the results. Change your phone's wallpaper to remind
you to read if you need to. It's worth it.

Caveat: This does require you to keep your book within reach and visible as often as
possible. Plan ahead!

## Tip 2: Start by reading a single book at a time

As you start learning, you get excited when you see all the
possibilities within your grasp. Never forget, "Stop starting, start
finishing." Generally, for better or for worse, the end of the book is often when
everything comes together and the author "blows your mind."

{{< figure src="/img/stop-starting-start-finishing.jpg" position="center" caption="Words to live by." >}}

Choose your book carefully, and do your best not to start another one before you finished
your current one. Use this as motivation to get through your current
book, if needed!

Personally, shelving  a book without finishing it only leaves me more
confused. It gives me some pieces of the puzzle, but since I lack pieces I
will never see that puzzle to completion. Bite the bullet, and finish
the books you start, unless they are novels that fail to grab your
attention.

You might want to wait  until you are in the final pages of a book before ordering your
next one. You don't want to make commitments that you might not be able
to complete! I strongly advise to order only a single book at a time, especially at the start of your learning journey -
don't get carried away!


## Tip 3: Track your progress by folding the corners

This is a big part of my system.

I vaguely remember coming across an online debate about using bookmarks
vs. folding corners. In the past, I would have been in the bookmark
camp, but I'm now clearly a folded corners guy.

Each page has two corners and I use this to my full advantage. The
top corner indicates my reading progress, and the bottom corner
indicates my note-taking progress. And no risk of having your bookmark
fall out of the book!

{{< figure src="/img/folded-corners-system.png" position="center" caption="" >}}

I can't overstate how useful this is. It gives the feeling that no moment
spent reading or taking notes is wasted. Whenever something else needs
my attention, I simply fold the corner, fully aware that whenever I'll
come back to the book, I will know exactly what I was up to. Simply put,
it reduces my cognitive load to a minimum.

I also like the fact that this transforms the act of learning
into two distinct activities:
- reading
- writing

If I'm in the mood for reading, I read. If I'm in the mood for writing,
I write. I feel like I am free to choose what activity is right for what
time. And, most importantly, whatever I end up choosing, I am constantly
learning.

## Tip 4: Use the body of your highlighter as a visual aid

When I picture someone reading, I often see them using their finger to
track their progress, like this:

{{< figure src="/img/reading-with-finger.png" position="center" caption="" >}}
{{< figure src="/img/reading-with-finger.jpg" position="center" caption="" >}}

However, this method of tracking progress never felt right to me. There
are many reasons why:

- My finger is too big to accurately point to specific words on a page
- To reach the full width of the page with my finger, I have to move my
  entire arm back and forth as I read, or move the arm holding the book. It wastes energy.
- I don't particularly appreciate the friction of the page on the tip of
  my index, especially over extended periods of time.

The method I now use to guide my eyes as I read is to use the full body
of my
highlighter. Since my system is based on Matt Morris' learning strategy,
I always have a highlighter in my hands when I read, so this puts it to
good use.

{{< figure src="/img/read-with-highlighter.jpg" position="center" caption="" >}}

This has many benefits:

- Unlike the tip of your finger, the body of the highlighter is flat. It
  makes it obvious what line you are currently looking at.
- You can let your eyes glide along the body of the eye-lighter. It
  feels less jittery than following the movement of a finger, which can
  only point to one word at a time.
- The body of the highlighter is:
   - long enough to allow me to reach the full width of a page within
      having to move my wrist, let alone my arm.
   - vivid in color, which makes it quite eye-catching.
   - wide enough to hide the sentences below what I am reading, which
     ensures I am not reading "in diagonal".

## Tip 5: Identify elements of an enumeration in the text

I noticed that some authors like to create enumerations in prose instead
of in a list form. In order to help my future note-taking self, I use my
pen to circle where each element of an enumeration begins in a
paragraph. It makes the information much easier to parse later on. It also signals that this information would be more visually striking if written as a list: 

- First, ...
- Second, ...
- Finally, ...

{{< figure src="/img/enumeration.jpg" position="center" caption="" >}}

## Tip 6: Use your book's margins to write ideas

If reading a certain paragraph triggers a light bulb in your mind or
makes you pause and wonder about a specific question, I recommend that
you write that thought in the margins next to the paragraph that
inspired it. That way, when writing your notes, you will be able to
revisit your own good ideas and decide how to expand upon it.

Don't let a good idea go to waste!

{{< figure src="/img/good-margin-notes.jpg" position="center" caption="" >}}

## Tip 7: Number your notebook's pages

If your notebook doesn't have page numbers already (most don't), I
strongly recommend that you number your pages yourself. This is
invaluable to allow you to reference your notes later on. This
is a quality of life upgrade that is too obvious to live without.

If you have to number your notebook's pages, take this opportunity to
use a different ink (e.g. red) than what you would use for your note
taking. Things will look much clearer when you reach the bottom right
corner of odd-numbered pages. :wink:

## Tip 8: If you notebook doesn't have margins, make some!

For most of my life, I assumed the margin was meant for graders to
review your work and comment on their corrections. Well, news flash: the
margin is for everybody!

It's a shame that most quality notebooks that I know of don't have
margins. Use this to your advantage: make your margins as wide or as
thin as you need.

{{< figure src="/img/margins.jpg" position="center" caption="" >}}

In my notes, sometimes I write questions or things that will need
further updates. The margins is the perfect place to put such updates.
Of course, not all of your notes will require a margin note, but that's
a good thing: it leaves you with more room for the notes that truly need
commenting later on.

## Tip 9: Write the source of your knowledge nuggets

{{< figure src="/img/notes-source.png" position="center" caption="" >}}

Notice in the photo above that most "knowledge nuggets" are paired with a
reference to the source material. This helps finding context or
correcting notes in the rare cases where your notes are unclear and you
must refer to the book. Trust me, it can save you a lot
of time, and also makes sharing that nugget in the
future even easier (e.g. "As the *DevOps Handbook* says on page 49, improvement
of daily work is even more important than daily work!").

Side effects may include people calling you a bookworm.

## Tip 10: Use a URL shortener to encode web links in your notebook

This is very nerdy, but also very cool *and* useful. See an example in
the image below:

{{< figure src="/img/note-short-url.png" position="center" caption="" >}}

See that strange `(F)/bcm`? The circled F is a shorthand for https://felx.cc. If you visit https://felx.cc/bcm, you'll
be taken to this link instead: https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNkyXbkGnqpbp38J_f57sodGkG801H4lzJiwqTcInRbMmU38EKrqHbP28fZ9afKpw?key=WVB3UWdrUHNxS3duR0loTXY4ZEU5d084X29iSGp3, which is a photo I took of a page in a book for convenience. Thus, https://felx.cc/bcm is my short URL: it is convenient to type on any device, and can redirect me to a much more unwieldy URL.

Thus, a URL shortener is a service that allows you to create a small
link that can redirect to a link of any length. This is invaluable: it
allows me to save important, complicated links directly alongside my
reading notes, where I know they will be most useful.

If you are interested in trying a URL shortening service, many services
already offer free tiers:

- https://bitly.com/
- https://www.shorturl.at/
- https://tinyurl.com/app
- https://cutt.ly/fr
- https://free-url-shortener.rb.gy/
- https://t.ly/
- ...

However, if you're a computer nerd and would like to possess *your* own
URL shortening service (like I do with https://felx.cc/, that is fully
owned by me!), I recommend you check out [a video I made on how to
get started with
VanityURL](/posts/2024/01/vanityurls-a-convenient-diy-url-shortener-service/).

## Tip 11: Give your book away

This is the fun part. When you finished reading a book and collecting
all its nuggets in your journal, you are free to share it with the
world. In fact, I think it's better to bring the book out of your home
and find it a new library where it will be happy. In my case, since my
employer sometimes provides me a personal wellness account that funds my book
purchases, I think it's a no-brainer to bring these books back to the
office, where I know they will benefit my colleagues.

Writing the Slack message announcing the newly available book in the
library is the victory lap.

{{< figure src="/img/book-sharing.png" position="center" caption="" >}}

For the *DevOps Handbook*, since this book meant a lot for me during my
personal development, I added a little note on the title page. Who
knows, maybe this little encouragement will make a difference for the
next person who will start this book!

{{< figure src="/img/encouraging-others.jpg" position="center" caption="" >}}

## Tip 12: Share your notes online

I developed the habit to scan my notes once they
are complete for a given book and putting them on my Google Drive. This has many advantages:

- It creates a true cloud-supported backup, meaning that I would most
  likely have to delete the files myself to lose them.
- It allows me to browse my notes even when I don't have my physical
  books with me. This is critical as I tend to accumulate more and more
  notebooks.
- It shows people my actual work. This is an important part of the
  trust-earning process. People won't believe you put in the work until
  they see proof that makes it safe for them to believe you.

If you are looking for a flatbed scanner, the one I am currently using
is the [Canon LiDE 400](https://amazon.ca/dp/B07GPS69KF) and I am
totally satisfied with it. Recommended!

After scanning my notes, I write a new post with all my favorite quotes
from my note. I call those :star: Star Quotes :star:. I then proceed to
write a short review for the book. Having to summarize my understanding
of the book and writing about my appreciation of it is what really
cements it in my brain. A bonus side effect of that is that it creates a
nice [virtual bookshelf](/bookshelf) that I can use to retrieve my notes
and even share them with interested parties.

{{< figure src="/img/virtual-bookshelf.png" position="center" caption="[My virtual bookshelf](/bookshelf)" >}}

## Tip 13: Remember: Reading a book twice is inefficient

I've hinted at it before, but I'll say it clearly once more: If you are
reading a book a second time, what does this say about the first time
you read it? Life if too short to read a book in its entirety twice.
Instead, rely on your notes to quickly get the essence of the book.
That's your reward for putting in this work: you can get the same info
as reading the full book in a fraction of the time.

## Tip 14: Additional tips on hardware

Alright, we are now getting into the nitty-gritty. For most of us, making a purchase is the fun, exciting part. My dopamine-hungry brain loves it when I buy stuff.

So, what hardware do I recommend, precisely?

#### Notebook

First off, this is probably basic common-sense, but I'll make it explicit, just in
case: Don't use a spiral-bound Hilroy notebook
or, worse, a stitched exercise book. These won't do much good here if pages
keep tearing and falling out of your journal after a few years.

The bound journal I've been using is the [TRU RED Medium Flexible Cover
Dotted Journal](https://www.staples.ca/products/2934243-en-tru-red-medium-flexible-cover-dotted-journal-black)
from Staples.

{{< figure src="/img/use-bound-journals.png" position="center" caption="" >}}

Note: Some people enjoy spiral-bound notebooks because they allow to
easily fold back the notebook and stay opened flat on a table. If you do
invest in a spiral-notebook, at least make sure it is high quality.


Also, I strongly recommend to use a grid or dotted journal.  This allows
better horizontal alignment of information for writing lists. It makes
my messy handwriting look less messy. Personally, I am
now very fond of dotted journals, because they provide the benefits of a
grid without being as visually distracting.

{{< figure src="/img/dotted-journal-2.png" position="center" caption="" >}}


#### Pens and highlighters

Take the time to really search for a pen that makes writing a joyful
experience for *you*.

If you're looking for recommendations, mine are:
- Pen: Bic Cristal (black or blue)
- Highlighter: Something basic and colorful, like [those sold at Staples](https://www.staples.ca/products/496808-en-chisel-tip-tank-style-highlighters-yellow-20-pack)

Why?

- They are cheap, easy to find and reliable
- The Bic Cristal does not smear (I'm left handed)
- The highlighter has lots of ink and lasts a long time

{{< figure scale="400px" src="/img/bic-cristal-and-highlighter.jpg" position="center" caption="So, am I a good [pen seller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UspZGJ-TrI)? ;)" >}}


#### Ruler

This allows you to make nice lines, for tables or underlines. Any cheap
15 cm ruler will do. It makes your journal more pleasing to read, which
is important. After all, the whole point of keeping a journal is so you
can comfortably refer to your knowledge.

The best storage place I found for my ruler is directly in my notebook. The notebook I recommend above has an elastic band that ensures your ruler would never slip and fall once shut.

{{< figure src="/img/ruler.jpg" position="center" caption="" >}}
