Because it is one of the tools of my trade (computer work), it might not surprise you that I have a deep
affection for keyboards and ergonomy. While I am no expert on the matter, my personal keyboard setup is
something that I try to optimize every day, even if just bit by bit. It is a complicated task because there
are many things to take into account:

* What size of keyboard do you need?
* How many keys do you need?
* How frequently do you use specific keys?
* How reliable do you need each key press to be?
* How fast do you need to be able to write?

These questions may seem frivolous for most people when keyboards are just a mean of inputing keys into a
computer, with no time limit or sense of danger. However, as you achieve higher and higher levels of security
clearence in the technological world, you start to realize that pressing keys can be as dangerous as handling
a sharp blade. Too often, one wrong key press can be the difference between global success and failure.

Not to get too overly dramatic, of course. I just want to picture how essential it feels to me to have the
freedom of optimizing my keyboard setup as much as I want. Fortunately, I do have that freedom, and it has
brought me delightful bits of joy that I wish to share with you today.

Nice quote about keyboards:



> “Cowboys in the western United States leave their horses when they die. But never leave their saddles, regardless of how long they need to walk in the desert. Saddles are interfaces that are deeply adapted to our bodies whereas horses are consumable items. It should not be forgotten that computers are consumables nowadays, but keyboards are interfaces that we can use through our lives.”

- Eiiti Wada, Professor Emeritus at the University of Tokyo

Ideas

- I started looking into mechanical keyboards after trying one to play Stepmania at an anime convention. My
  taps felt way more satisfying and reliable. I wanted a mechanical keyboard for gaming purposes, to get an
  edge in my scoring
- My first mechanical keyboard was fully customized in its looks, but not in its functionality (wasd
  keyboard). I took it without a numpad because I figured I don't need that (I rarely input numbers, if I need
  to I can get an additional dongle, etc). It was big and I liked it.
- I have come to realize that it is important for a keyboard not to move while you type. If you want
  precision, it is crucial for your keyboard to be as immobile as a stone
- I got a cherry mx board 3.0 for work initially because I wanted a no frills board, that I wouldn't fear to
  get stolen from me, and that I could still game on. This purchase ended up being a mistake that I regretted
  because this keyboard was not right for me.
- My next purchase was the Vortex Race 3, and I struck gold. Three years after initial purchase, it is still
  fully suited to my needs, thanks to its ability to program macros directly on the keyboard itself. All keys
  can be used as macros, not just dedicated keys.
- In my opinion, high-tech keyboard enthusiasts focus too much on the switch type, i.e. how a key feels when
  it is pressed. Sure, a mechanical key is generally better than any other type of key: this is what will make
  your key presses consistent. However, I don't think this is where the "keyboard endgame" lies. I think
  flexible layouts is really what will send your keyboard-game to the stratosphere. Having 10g vs 20g of force
  required for a key press makes a difference, sure. Applying lubricants inside your key switches will make a
  difference, sure. There are so many things one can do to optimize their keyboard. However, in my experience,
  a good layout is effort better invested: it is not something that hardware can break, in theory. It is
  something you will be able to rely on for a longer period of time.


# Macros

## Volume keys

F11 and F12, quick and easy way to lower and raise volume

## Stealing ideas from the Happy Hacking Keyboard

The Happy Hacking Keyboard has interesting key placement. 

- Control in place of Caps Lock: game changer
- Backspace in place of `\` key
- Many other small changes, but mainly these two interest me

With a programmable keyboard such as the Vortex Race 3, I can steal these ideas and implement them in my own
board without needing to modify my OS settings and without needing to purchase an additional piece of
equipment if I want to try a specific ergonomy.

## Hiding your PC's password in a macro

This is something I don't feel comfortable recommending to people who work in a public environment, but it is
something I really enjoy doing when working from home.

My PC password is very long, to make sure it is secure. to be precise, it is 23 characters long. I hate having
to type it everything I run a command as `sudo`, even though by the nature of things I got pretty good at
typing it over time.

What I did is I stored my password in a Fn+Key combination. Fast, easy, reliable. Not truly secure, but I can
remove it anytime I want.

## Knowing your OS's shortcuts

This is something I notice a lot of people tend to neglect.

Every operating system, whether it's Linux, Windows or even (_even!_) Mac OS, has its keyboard shortcuts that
are meant to make your life easier. They were put in place by the people who programmed that operating system
because they found them:

- ergonomic
- quick
- reliable

Most of us probably remember the difference it made when we started doing ctrl-c / ctrl-v instead of
right-click -> copy, right-click -> paste to paste something from a clipboard.

But it's rare for people to use more shortcuts than that. I don't know why: wouldn't everybody want to make
their life as efficient and pain-free as possible? Look at this list of basic shortcuts from Ubuntu:

https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/keyboard-nav.html
https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/shell-keyboard-shortcuts.html.en

These are goldmines and are worth learning through physical memory. They will make your every day life much
easier. In fact, today I learned that Super-Shift-Arrow moves a window from one screen to the next. No need to
use my mouse to do this anymore!
