Now I know what you're thinking... This blog post isn't very impressive looking.  Well, I'm still quite proud
of it! This is my first blog post using Hugo, a static website generator. In the past, I would have used more
common blogging tools, such as the ubiquitous "blogger", or "wordpress". The thing you have to know about me,
however, is that I really enjoy customization. Some might (rightfully) call me a hipster in certain
situations. I'm very excited to see what I will be able to achieve with this blog!

Here is what this post looks like to me as I am currently writing it:

So, what do you think? :smiley: Pretty nifty stuff, huh? Are now here's how my
writing
program looks like:

Those among you with a sharp eye will probably recognize a bash shell running
vim and tmux, with a Windows XP flavor to solidify the retro feel. It's not
obvious from the screenshot, but my current operating system is Linux Mint
18.04. 

Yep, I'm one of those weirdos who use a Windows theme on their Linux
installation. Double hipster.

As a note to myself, I'll just leave this here: to write my next post, all I
have to do is type in the root of this directory
```bash
# From the root directory of the website
$ hugo new posts/MySecondPost.md
```
Everything has been set in place in order to work with the current theme. (Sorry
if that part didn't really make sense, now you know what I sound like when I
talk to myself!)

Have a good night and see you soon, dear reader.
