description: In 2023, I have read 43 [books](https://felixleger.com/books), a major step-up from 2022's 8! I thought it would be interesting to look back and at the books I rated with a double thumbs up (üëçüëç), which is currently the [highest rating](/posts/2023/10/my-book-ratings-explained/) I allow myself to give to a book. This year was a great year, because I found 14 books that deeply resonated with me. Let's have a look at them now!

# :star: Crucial Conversations
{{< figure src="/img/reads/crucial-conversations.png" position="center" caption="" style="height: auto; width: 100%;" >}}

[Link to my original review](https://felixleger.com/books/book-46-crucial-conversations)

On the topic of interesting conversations, this one was a real light bulb
moment for me. If [How to Win Friends and Influence
People](https://felixleger.com/books/book-21-how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people)
taught me how to be a better listener, Crucial Conversations taught me
how to be a better responder. Immediately after finishing it, I was
amazed at how it allowed me to take a step back in conversations that
previously seemed dramatic, and often ended badly. I became much more
controlled in my approach. I think this is because of the notion of Path
to Action, that taught me how my (often flawed) interpretation of facts
led me to (often unfortunate) actions. This was one of my blind spots,
and by shedding some light on it, I think I became a better person.

My original review for Radical Candor was pretty short:

>  Essential reading for anyone who has to interact with a manager or employees on a daily basis!

I know I tend to talk in hyperbole when I'm excited about something,
but in this case I genuinely believe this book should be read by anyone
with a boss or who's a boss. In a tight little package, Kim Scott
manages to give a simple framework for giving and graciously receiving
feedback. As you probably know, feedback is information, and information
is the source of all power. To know how to handle feedback is the golden
key to healthy and productive collaboration. One of the reasons why I
want to put this book in the hands of so many people is because it
really allows to better understand the reality of the other: as a
worker, you will better understand the constraints within which your
boss must operate, and as a boss you will better understand the effect
you have on your subordinates.

Don't wait for your company to give you management training. Go straight
to the source and read this amazing book!
# :star:  Sooner Safer Happier {#ssh}
{{< figure src="/img/reads/sooner-safer-happier.png" position="center" caption="" style="height: auto; width: 100%;" >}}

[Link to my original review](https://felixleger.com/books/book-25-sooner-safer-happier)

This book was a revelation. What it did for me is take a bunch of puzzle
pieces I already had (e.g. [Project to
Product](https://felixleger.com/books/book-17-project-to-product), [The
DevOps
Handbook](https://felixleger.com/books/book-12-the-devops-handbook),
[Making Work
Visible](https://felixleger.com/books/book-16-making-work-visible),
[Team Topologies](https://felixleger.com/books/book-11-team-topologies))
and connected them together in a single, illuminating package.

What I
especially love about this book is its structure. Each chapter has two
parts: anti-pattern and pattern. It begins by describing all the
consequences of our ignorance of specific patterns that happen in
business, and then flips the situation around by showing what to change
in those situations and what effect to expect. If you
are at all interested in subjects related to DevOps and productivity, I
could not recommend this book enough. This one deserves a gold star, for
sure.

# :star: The Fearless Organization
{{< figure src="/img/reads/the-fearless-organization.png" position="center" caption="" style="height: auto; width: 100%;" >}}

[Link to my original review](https://felixleger.com/books/book-30-the-fearless-organization)

This book single-handedly coined the term "psychological safety." Amy
Edmondson should win a Nobel prize for this achievement.

Looking back on situations of your life, can you identify instances
where you now think "I should have spoken up"? It could be during a
meeting, during a family reunion, during an important operation with the
head surgeon... All of us, at some points in our life, choose to
withhold the truth. This has immeasurable consequences to the people
around us, and to ourselves. And the common denominator in all of these
instances, is *lack* of psychological safety.

I can't express enough how important this book is to me. After reading
it, all I could think about was how much I could literally feel the
presence or absence of psychological safety in specific relationships,
in specific groups or group settings. Relationships that are built on
psychological safety are more efficient and more comfortable. To me,
psychological safety really is the magic ingredient that allows us to be
both happy and productive.

# :star: The Fifth Discipline {#tfd}
{{< figure src="/img/reads/the-fifth-discipline.png" position="center" caption="" style="height: auto; width: 100%;" >}}

[Link to my original review](https://felixleger.com/books/book-35-the-fifth-discipline)

This book taught me about the discipline of Systems Thinking. Wow, what
a ride. It was like learning a new language, except, this language made
it easier for me to interpret the world I was living in.

This is a big book that goes in many different directions. It's a
masterful book. It teaches us how to think about one of the most
elusive concept of all: cause and effect.

I don't know what else to say about this one, other than "holy moly,
this was written in 1990!" Had this come out today, it would still be a
smash hit. Its insight is absolutely timeless. Check it out.







# :star: Wiring the Winning Organization
{{< figure src="/img/reads/wiring-the-winning-organization.png" position="center" caption="" style="height: auto; width: 100%;" >}}

[Link to my original
review](https://felixleger.com/books/book-58-wiring-the-winning-organization)

Last, but certainly not least, we have this new freshly published book
from Gene Kim and Steven Spear. In my opinion, "The Death of DevOps"
could have been a fitting alternate title to this one.

I find it poetic that Gene Kim, who wrote [The DevOps
Handbook](https://felixleger.com/books/book-12-the-devops-handbook), is
now giving us a book that goes one step further and allows us to do
without the "DevOps" buzzword which, to me, has started to lose some of
its shine and meaning. The concept of the three layers of work is both
such a simple and deep concept, it's hard to believe that no one thought
of it before. It's a game changer. From this point on, instead of saying
that some company has "good DevOps practices" (whatever that means),
I'll simply say that they wired themselves for success.

A simple change, yes. But naming things right is important. And with
this book, I believe Kim and Spear have knocked their naming out of the
park. Kudos!


# Come As You Are
{{< figure src="/img/reads/come-as-you-are.png" position="center" caption=""  style="height: auto; width: 100%;" >}}

[Link to my original review](https://felixleger.com/books/book-47-come-as-you-are)

We'll begin this list with a banger, a book on self-acceptance in the
context of sexuality. After being in a relationship with my partner for
a number of years, it seems normal to start having a few doubts and
questions related to sexuality. This was the first book I read on the
topic and it basically showed me how ignorant I truly was. In this
sense, I can't say this book is guaranteed to make anyone's sex life go
from terrible to great after you're done reading it (that will take a
long, slow, challenging and hopefully rewarding process), but it was a
great start for me and I feel safe recommending it to anyone. If you're
living with a partner, try to read it with them for best results. It
will surely spark some interesting conversations!


# Shape Up
{{< figure src="/img/reads/shape-up.png" position="center" caption="" style="height: auto; width: 100%;" >}}

[Link to my original review](https://felixleger.com/books/book-22-shape-up)

When designing a timeline and scope for a project, people tend to
determine a scope from requirements and attempt to determine what
timeline can fit with that scope. For example, "We'll build a 3 floor
building, and that should take *roughly* 4 months."

The core idea of Shape Up can be summarized with a single, but genius,
idea, that involves flipping around the old management habit; Instead of
fixing the scope, fix the timeline, *then* see what you can reasonably
scope inside it. In essence, finishing on time is more important than
fully realizing your vision. For example, "In exactly 4 months from now,
we will open a location that will be able to house 18 humans."

I love that, for so many reasons. People who find themselves
missing deadlines probably were working on requirements that were too
rigid ("It has to look exactly like the vision I have in my head"), or
too vague (someone did a bad shaping job). It completely flips the
traditional and sometimes tired practice of Scrum Sprints on its head
and I think Shaping is a better system for delighting customers and
shareholders, because its first objective is to ship *on time* the
minimum that will satisfy your stakeholders. You can never re-do a first impression, and in business I believe
most first impressions revolve around punctuality.

# Start With Why
{{< figure src="/img/reads/start-with-why.png" position="center" caption="" style="height: auto; width: 100%;" >}}

[Link to my original review](https://felixleger.com/books/book-26-start-with-why)

This book is a classic that seemingly needs no introduction. Apparently,
I had been living under a rock for many years, because I had no idea who
Simon Sinek was before beginning this book. When I finished it, everyone
I talked to seemed to know not only who he was, but what the theory
behind the golden circle of (What(How(Why))).

What this book taught me is the power of vision. What you do doesn't
matter as much as your true reasons for doing it. Literally, "it's the
intention that counts." People can tell the difference when you do
something good for the wrong reasons. Powerful and timeless insight,
indeed!

# The 48 Laws of Power
{{< figure src="/img/reads/the-48-laws-of-power.png" position="center" caption="" style="height: auto; width: 100%;" >}}

[Link to my original review](https://felixleger.com/books/book-55-the-48-laws-of-power)

Apparently, gaining access to this book is forbidden in many prisons
over the world.

This fact alone makes this imposing book seem like a weapon. And I can't
say I disagree with that; this book is really a double-edged sword. It
cuts through the bullshit and, whoever you are, it will point a finger
at whatever you've been doing wrong when handling power. While I was
reading it, I couldn't stop thinking that this felt like a guide on the
literal physics of Power.

The book is structured similarly to [Sooner Safer
Happier](#ssh). Each law is explained through "observances" and
"transgressions" of the law, through stories of human history. In a
sense, this can seem anecdotal, akin to cherry-picking, but the examples
are well chosen and powerfully (!) illustrate the author's point.
Personally, I think it taught me a great deal about how to observe
myself in public, and what bad habits to look out for, in order to have
better working relationships.

# The Phoenix Project
{{< figure src="/img/reads/the-phoenix-project.png" position="center" caption="" style="height: auto; width: 100%;" >}}

[Link to my original review](https://felixleger.com/books/book-41-1-the-phoenix-project)

Ah, the good old Phoenix Project. The first time I read this book was in
2019, and now I read it a second time in 2023, now better armed with my
[learning
system](https://felixleger.com/posts/2022/08/overcoming-learning-anxiety/).
What's interesting about this book is that it's written as a novel,
which makes it more accessible to a larger audience. It really opened
the doors to DevOps for me, and put me on a long, windy road that only
today I am starting to make more sense of. In my opinion, it shatters
the myth that DevOps is all about the pipeline, and instead shows that
at its core, DevOps is really centered on how you handle people and your
processes.

If you are beginning your learning journey and are interested about
boosting your organization's productivity, I think this is the starting
point you are looking for. When you are done, my recommendation is to
then check out [Sooner Safer Happier](#ssh).

# Thinking in Systems
{{< figure src="/img/reads/thinking-in-systems.png" position="center" caption="" style="height: auto; width: 100%;">}}

[Link to my original review](https://felixleger.com/books/book-39-thinking-in-systems)

I had to read this book to pay my respects to the pioneering work of
Donella H. Meadows, the woman who single-handedly created Systems
Thinking. This book is essentially a condensed version of [The Fifth
Discipline](#tfd). If you are intimidated by the length and Depth of The
Fifth Discipline, look no further than this book. It's gold.

# What Color Is Your Parachute
{{< figure src="/img/reads/what-color-is-your-parachute.png" position="center" caption="" style="height: auto; width: 100%;" >}}

[Link to my original review](https://felixleger.com/books/book-52-what-color-is-your-parachute)

I had to look for a job in 2023, and I had this book on my radar for
quite some time. Now was the perfect moment to give it a chance!

I was amazed to find out that this book has been edited almost every
year since it's initial publication in 1970. That's something I didn't
realize was possible! I could definitely feel its effect as I was
reading it, though: advice was fresh and relevant, unafraid to talk
about today's technologies and tricks to job hunting because the editor knows that if they become
obsolete, they'll just update them in next year's edition of the book.

If you're currently looking for your "dream job" or you know someone
who's on the hunt, this one is a classic. It will make you work (and
even encourage you to start writing *in the book*!), but if you do the
exercises dutifully, I'm sure it will pay off. It did for me.

# When They Win, You Win
{{< figure src="/img/reads/when-they-win-you-win.png" position="center" caption="" style="height: auto; width: 100%;" >}}

[Link to my original review](https://felixleger.com/books/book-43-when-they-win-you-win)

"When They Win, You Win." This should be hammered in every manager's
brain.

This is the perfect companion book to [Radical Candor](#rc). The angle
this book takes is one of how to build deeper, truer rapport with your
colleagues and subordinates. It reminds us that everyone is human,
everyone has a story, and everyone has goals shaped by that story. My
favorite notion of the book is the "[Career
Conversation](https://coda.io/@they-win-you-win/career-conversations-tool)", a series of
questions to ask yourself or your subordinate in a 1:1 meeting in order
to better understand where that person comes from, and where they want
to be headed. I tried those questions on myself and I could feel their
surgical precision. Good stuff.
