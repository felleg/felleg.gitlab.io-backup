*(Disclaimer: I am not a security expert. This post describes my current security setup, but every setup is as
secure as its weakest link. Please remember to be critical when security topics are being discussed.)*

It is 1998. I am 5 years old.

"Ok FÃ©lix, if you want to log into the family computer, you will have to create your own password.", says my dad to me.

"What is a password?", I reply.

"It's a secret word that the computer uses to recognize you."

"*Cool*. My password will be... --------."

Fast-forward to present day. It is 2020. I have 295 accounts scattered around the Internet. I have finally rid myself of this password on all my accounts. It is
no longer part of my identity, which is why I can share it with the world today. Believe me, it feels *good*.
