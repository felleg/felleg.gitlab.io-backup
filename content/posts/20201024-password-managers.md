*(Disclaimer: I am not a security expert. Though I try to have the best possible practices, I cannot guarantee
these tips will prevent you from getting hacked. Know that every security setup is as secure as its weakest
link. Please remember to be critical when security topics are being discussed.)*

It is 1998. I am 5 years old.

"Ok FÃ©lix, if you want to log into the family computer, you will have to create your own password.", says my dad to me.

"What is a password?", I reply.

"It's a secret word that the computer uses to recognize you."

"*Cool*. My password will be..."

# tazmanio

For a brief history of the "password", checkout [this interesting article from
mashable](https://mashable.com/2013/12/30/history-of-the-password/). In this post, I will instead give you my
perspective on growing up alongside the Internet in a world where web security is a relatively alien concept
to most people.

We all start with a single password. It seems to be like the only way we can remember it. Something "unique"
to ourself that we have not told anyone, yet we know we can't forget. The more we use it, the more we go down
this spiral. 

My first password was `tazmanio`. I based it off a game called [Taz in Escape from
Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taz_in_Escape_from_Mars) which I was playing at the time. I figured "taz"
and "tasmania" were both too easy to guess, so I twisted the end with an `o` and that was that. Eight
characters long. No capitalization. No special characters. There were no best practices to follow back then.
And I believe me, used it *everywhere*.

I was not the only one. The temptation was too strong. When the notion of "passwords" was created, the
internet did not exist. A password was meant to authenticate you on a unique, physical machine.

Fast-forward to present day. It is 2020. I have 295 accounts scattered around the Internet. I have finally rid myself of this password on all my accounts. It is
no longer part of my identity, which is why I can share it with the world today. Believe me, it feels *good*.

# Passwords are here to stay

Let's admit it. At best, the notion of passwords were a naive idea in the early days. In the present, they are
not enough to be considered "secure". At the same time, it is impossible to find a perfect solution for
everyone. Any attempt will have a weaker link that will be exploitable/ So, what can we realistically do to
protect ourselves from forgery while impacting our every day use of technology as little as possible?
design?

# A grain of salt

I must nuance this story somewhat. Using Bitwarden as my password manager has not solved everything. Indeed,
I have to keep these passwords in my head:

* My Bitwarden master password
* My phone's lock screen password
* My laptops' password(s)

This is list still much better than it used to be. Out of all of them, only Bitwarden could potentially be
cracked by hackers through the internet, since it doesn't require access to a physical device. This is where
Two-factor authentication comes in to save the day!

What was your first password? How did you come up with it? And when did you finally break from its shackles?
