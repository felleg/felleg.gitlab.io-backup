I made an animated visualization of the analysis I made in my earlier post [Stop Comparing Yourself to
Others](/posts/2022/01/stop-comparing-yourself-to-others/) using [Flourish](https://flourish.com), a visualization tool I had not
heard of before today. It turns out that it's a quite neat plug-and-play piece of software, I really recommend
it if you need to put data in motion for demonstration purposes.

In this video, I track users of the website [FlashFlashRevolution](https://flashflashrevolution.com) who have
the most amount of content featured in the game. This is quite a niche analysis, but I hope you will feel
inspired by it to try your hand at visualization. Let me know if you have any questions :smile:
