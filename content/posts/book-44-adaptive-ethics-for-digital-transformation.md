üëç - This book prompts us to grapple with uncomfortable yet essential questions that we often overlook or intentionally avoid. It's a reminder that decisions on matters like privacy, productivity, profits, and agility shape our lives, especially in an era of digital transformation. While easy solutions are notably absent, the book offers a set of virtues that appear crucial for successful digital shifts within organizations. The author's in-depth breakdown of the bureaucratic organization myth stands out to me, providing a compelling argument against embracing such outdated structures. I appreciated how this book made me realize that the definition of success evolves depending on the perspective you choose. It's Systems Thinking all over again!
