Where does one start with an album such as The Mother Stone from actor Caleb Landry Jones?

I guess I could explain how I stumbled upon it. Simply enough, I was browsing my Spotify Discover Weekly
playlist, and stumbled upon a song called "Flag Day / The Mother Stone" which featured the grotesque artwork
you're probably uncomfortably staring at. The song quickly sank its hooks in me with its absurd circus
overtones, brisk tempo changes done in slow-motion, and undeniable frontman charisma. Soon enough, I was
listening to the entire album, scratching my head at was I was listening to. Was I listening to a mad man, a
genius?


In order to help answer this question, I wanted to know the current consensus of the music press about this
album. Many publications, such as
[pitchfork.com](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/caleb-landry-jones-the-mother-stone/), seemed to be
slightly torn about the album. While the reviewers found it interesting, they couldn't understand what the
artist was trying to communicate. The songs sound great, but none are memorable. The theatrics are engaging,
but the lyrics are nonsensical. Above all, the album was deemed too long for its own good.


While I certainly agree that the album is far from perfect, I believe I caught a glimpse of what Caleb was
trying to do through this album. In short, The Mother Stone feels like a perfect fusion of The Beatles' White
Album with King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard's Nonagon Infinity. A perfectly psychedelic rock medley that has a
beginning but no end. Caleb himself states [that he wanted to make the album one long
song](https://www.insidehook.com/article/music/caleb-landry-jones-mother-stone-interview), probably not unlike
what Jethro Tull did with Thick as a Brick. Indeed, the album plays seemlessly from front to back, with the
added quality of having a completely ambiguous ending. Thus, playing the full album on repeat, you'd never be
able to guess where the album ends and where it begins, unless you had already listened to its over four
times. Despite feeling like walking through molasses, the album manages to constantly throw surprises at you. 

I can't imagine how deceptively difficult it must be to perform this album: playing it live, with no breaks,
would certainly feel like walking on a tight rope.



In conclusion, I think Caleb Landry Jones is neither a mad man, nor a genius. I believe he is a sensitive soul
that mirrors the absurdity of our current existence, without any apology. The music is complex without ever
moving faster than a walking pace. Some dissonances and hard riffs are to be expected, but they are often
balanced by genuine moments of unstable peace and tranquility. This is an album that is not ashamed of the sound
of its breathing. It is honestly beautiful to see the level of acceptance Caleb granted himself on his first
album. While not everything is fresh or new, it is all done from an honest perspective meant to reward patient
listeners.
