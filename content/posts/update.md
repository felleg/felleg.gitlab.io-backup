Hey everyone! I hope you were not too worried about the sudden silence
over the past 9 months. Truth is, I have not found something I felt
compelled to write about. As it turns out, maintaining an *interesting*
blog is hard, or at least harder than I thought. But don't worry, I am
working on some projects in the background, and hopefully will be able
to share more soon. In fact, there is a lot I would want to write
about, but I am not used to write articles visible in public. I really
want to make sure I will find subjects that will interest you, when in
reality I should just focus on what interests me. As you can see, I'm
still trying to figure this out.

Either way, I hope you are doing well during this ongoing pandemic, and
I look forward to seeing you again. Bye for now!
