ðŸ‘Ž - Has some useful quotes, but I don't know what to think about the book itself. This is aimed at CEOs in manufacturing in the 2000s. I wonder how relevant some parts of the book are in today's reality. (Thanks Karim for this recommendation!)

Read [the notes I wrote](/books/execution.pdf) from this book.
