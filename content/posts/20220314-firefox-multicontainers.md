I use Firefox as my main browser and I have done so for years. The main reason
why I do is because it has a very robust feature called "multi-containers" that
allow you to create tabs that don't share sessions with other open tabs. For
example, with this add-on you can be browsing the same website with as many
containers as you would like. No need to use "incognito" or private mode
anymore!

Quick video to summarize:

You can download the Multi-Container add-on for Firefox [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/).

Firefox is not perfect, but its native multi-containers are priceless.
Apparently, Chrome users can use [SessionBox](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sessionbox-multi-login-to/megbklhjamjbcafknkgmokldgolkdfig?hl=en), but reviews seem to suggest a
poorer implementation than the one found on Firefox.
Yeah, this is a somewhat lazy, laid-back post, but I felt like sharing anyway.
Here's to tools that help raise our collective quality of life! :smile:
