In 2003, I was already ahead of the social media curve. Yes, I had my own personal web page (thanks, dad)!

As it currently stands, it is mostly a list of broken links to video game websites and Flash movies/games. It
is a nice little time capsule of the things that mattered most to me when I was 10 years old. Time flies, and
our analog minds cannot remember everything... Long live digital media!
