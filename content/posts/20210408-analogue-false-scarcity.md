What is Analogue doing? Shouldn't there be laws against this blatant false scarcity? These products are not
cheap! People fall prey to the sense of urgency and get ripped off!

I'm more glad than ever not to have given a penny to Analogue Co. Their business practices have never been as
shady as what they are doing today.

Guys, if you want to experience FPGA goodness, I'm not saying products from Analogue are bad. What I am saying
is that you are getting ripped off. [Just get a
