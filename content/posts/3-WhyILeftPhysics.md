Changing careers. It's not always pleasant.

I'm willing to bet that every day, at least one person reorients their career.
It's just a certainty of life: some people initially are going to choose the
wrong field. Yet, when it happens to us, we feel alone. It almost feels like we
ended up with the wrong career by mistake, or that we wasted time not working on
things we really enjoy. Or both.

You are not alone: I was also on the wrong track for some time (and I'm still
not exactly sure of where I'm going!).  My resume says I am a physicist. I even have a master's degree to prove it.
However, for the past 2 year, I have been developing software at CONTXTFUL
Technologies inc., a startup based in Montreal. How did this shift happen?

Here is my story.

The Tender Years
================
Back then, all that mattered were friends and video games. My father
was a system administrator at a bank, my mother was a dental
hygienist. I played The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages on my Game Boy
Color on road trips.  I don't remember much from that period, but I
remember I didn't want my dad's job: he was not exercising, his back
hurt, he was getting calls in the middle of the night. It seemed like
the worst kind of job possible.

As you might expect, this period worry-free period didn't last very long.

Getting a Diary
===============
On my 8th birthday, I received the usual gifts: a backpack,
educational PC games, etc. However, my grandparents sneaked in a blank
diary. The cover was made of metal, with a big red heart on the front.
It had an heart-shaped padlock. It came with a green mechanical pencil
equipped with green lead. The gift caught me by surprise. 

It was a sight to behold.

I wasn't immediately sure what I was meant to do with it and, let's be honest, I
wasn't sure I wanted anyone to see me holding this thing. "Write anything you
want in it. You can draw, you can write how you feel, you can write about your
day. Every page filled in this book is a gift to your future self.", my
grandmother told me in French. So I started writing!

That day, I wrote about the birthday I just had, time stamped and
all. And thanks to this gift, I can now remember everything.

More than any educational game, that empty book taught me how to write
and how to learn from my mistakes. I learned the value of written
words, safely guarded in their pages. I knew that whatever I was
looking for, that book was the place to look. I knew that whatever I
would write today, as insignificant as it seemed, would be cherished
by future me for enabling myself to *remember*. 

It honestly reminds me about the principles of documenting software: this diary
was my SSOT, my single source of truth.  But I digress!

I wrote about all the insecurities I had over the years, the thoughts
and reflections. They mostly seem really childish now, traces of a
different chapter in my life, but at the time they sometimes felt like
huge milestones. High school. My first girlfriend.  University.
Changing careers. Writing is still my best tool put things in
perspective, both in space and time.

Physics in high school
======================

So I enjoyed writing. Big woop. I still had to attend classes every day, where
daydreaming was not allowed.  Luckily, I really enjoyed my classes.  I was
fortunate enough to attend a private high school on the South Shore of Montreal.
I liked French classes, because I enjoyed writing. I also was interested in Math
as well as Science and Technology classes.  However, my first Physics class in
grade 11 completely rocked my world (in a good way). I was more than enjoying
this class, I was invested. I craved learning.  The then new concepts of vectors
and forces in particular changed my view of the world. I was consumed by the
love of Classical Mechanics, thanks to our teacher who did an incredible job at
easing us into this revolutionary world.

$$
\frac{\vec{F}}{m} = \vec{a} = \frac{\Delta \vec{v}}{\Delta t} = \frac{\frac{\Delta \vec{x}}{\Delta t}}{\Delta t}
$$

$$
\Delta x = \frac{a(\Delta t)^2}{2} + v\Delta t
$$

$$
v_f^2 - v_i^2 = 2a\Delta x
$$

My desire to apply the new formulas I had learned in class was such that
I was inventing problems for fun and showing them off to our teacher.
To everyone around I was surely being annoying, but I could not help
it. I felt as though, for the first time, I had connected with what I
would enjoy doing for the rest of my life.  This class, had become a
hobby, could lead into a real career! I was excited. I now wanted to
**teach physics**.

When the time came to choose our study program for Cegep, I chose
Health Science, because... I  didn't know Pure Science existed (do
your research, kids!). Two biology and an organic chemistry courses
later, I quickly realigned and selected a bidisciplinary
Mathematics-Physics program for college. I figured, since I had had my
fill of labs with the biology and chemistry courses, the right choice
for me was to opt for a program grounded in fundamental theories (I
don't know how I was so careless during this period. Again, do your
research, kids!).

The fun was about to begin.

Hello World
===========

As I was studying physics for my bachelor's degree, I was teaching
Cegep level physics to adults at college. I was having a blast.
Getting paid to do something you enjoy is like getting paid double
time. But then, the cracks started to show.

You know that feeling? The more you zoom into perfection, the more you notice
the imperfections?

I was feeling it hard. Tutoring is not as easy as it seems. If you give
everything you have in each lecture, like I was doing, you are going to run out
of steam quickly.  I was not prepared for this realization: doing what you enjoy
does not make you invincible.

Couple this with the fact that I was hearing left and right how limited the
Cegep teaching opportunities were currently, my spark for teaching became
attacked. What if I didn't want to teach physics to young adults for all my
life? What if all of this is just one big mistake?  How did I get here?

Changing careers. Or, in this case, changing fields. Here I was, faced
with a choice. But what were my other options? I was soon about to
find out.

In 2013, I attended my first laboratory course at college. Computational
physics. Our first lab was to compile a "hello world" program in C. *Cool, I
guess.*

The second lab is to compute gravitational interactions between the earth and the
moon. The third one was to compute and plot fractals from a random walkers
model. The fourth one was to simulate the spread of diseases in population of
random walkers. The fifth one was to simulate cars in traffic...

*Wait... My crappy laptop can do all of these simulations? Is there anything it
can't do!?*

I was completely mind blown. I had seen the light. Pen and paper just wouldn't
cut it anymore. If I had to do any computations, from now on, it would be using
a computer. Duh!

It truly was an ironic twist of fate, because I had sworn I would never follow
my dad's footsteps, but I ended up doing just that.

Landing a job at CONTXTFUL
==========================

I quickly realized that a bachelor's degree in physics by itself is not enough
to land a decent job. So what did I end up doing? If you guessed "get a master's
degree in physics, despite the revelation that my future lied with computers",
you'd be right!. For some reason, another degree in physics felt like the right
path. I chose a field of physics that was completely dependent on computers:
particle physics.  Was it a mistake?  Should I have studied software engineering
instead?

Maybe. I will never know.

Hindsight is 20/20. Take it from me: you cannot feel bad for doing what felt
like the courageous choice at the time. In defeat, better feel courageous than
foolish.

(wip)
Was not even called CONTXTFUL at the time: Proximity HCI, Spillad,
CONTXTFUL I was excited to work on projects involving computers and no
quantum mechanics. The specific of the project mattered very little. I
wanted to join the team because I trusted the one in charge (who is
now my boss) I messaged him every month, to stay in the loop, but also
because my thesis due date was approaching and I had no idea what
company would accept me with my background. I had an interview at
Morgan Stanley, and completely flopped. CONTXTFUL felt like my best
shot at working in software without going back to square one.

Writing software feels like writing a novel (?), this desire to write
things never left me

Writing this blog
=================

And so, here we are.

I'm still not entirely sure what to do with my life, but I have
learned to embrace this feeling. It is what gives me the curiosity to
move forward and discover things that go beyond my own imagination. I
now know when something feels **right** for me, like writing this blog
for example. There are certain activities that feel effortless, so
effortless in fact that at times the true struggle is to wait until
after work to do them! At that point, work stops becoming work and
becomes a game. I'm all about games!



I have lots of friends in physics who are afraid they don't fit in the
current state of the industry. To them, I say: don't be afraid. You
are not a failure if you are not one of the 10% PhD's who land a
position in academia, etc.

I was always aimed at doing physics or teaching When I ended up doing
it, the only thing I knew is that academic research was not for me.
Now I know I found my niche, and yet, I still feel like an imposter.
The feeling never stops?

In Conclusion
=============

I think the dream of finding a job where "you like what you do" is naive.
Choosing your hobby as your job is also risky. A job is a job; there is an ugly
side to everything. 

In the end, I think the best you could hope for is to fall in love with
your job's problems.
