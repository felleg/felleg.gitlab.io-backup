Changing careers.

I'm willing to bet that every day, at least one person reorients their career. It's just a certainty of life:
some people are going to choose the wrong field. Yet, when it happens to us, it almost feels like we ended up
with the wrong career by mistake, or that we wasted time not working on things we really enjoy. Or both.

I hope you don't mind me telling you my life story for a minute. For the past 2 years, I have been developing
software for CONTXTFUL Technologies inc., a startup based in Montreal. However, my resume says I am a
physicist. I even have a master's degree to prove it. How did this shift happen?

In my experience, there are a few key moments in your life where your eyes light up and realize: "Wow. I also
want to do that. I can see myself doing that for a **long** time!".

The tender years
================
All that matter are friends and video games. My father is a system administrator for a bank, my mother is a
dental hygienist. I didn't want my dad's job: he was not exercising, his back hurt, he was getting calls in
the middle of the night. It seemed like the worst kind of job possible.

Reading Harry Potter at 8
=========================
I want to be a writer, I want to make other people feel what I felt when reading that series. I started a
diary because my grandmother gave me one as a gift. I still write occasionally and enjoy reading all the
things I wrote at the time. The insecurities I had, the thoughts and all that, they seem really dumb now, but
at the time they felt like huge milestones. Writing is what helps me put things in perspective, both in space
and time.

Physics course in high school
=============================
I want to be a teacher, write problems (which I did), make the course as interesting to others as I found it
interesting. I ended up choosing Health Sciences by mistake (I wanted pure science, but people seemed to find
that stuff boring, and I never bothered to check what pure science was... I was so stupid. 2 Biology courses
and organic Chemistry later, I chose Physics for college to focus on what I really enjoyed)

Tutoring cegep level courses at college
=======================================
I felt at home, but I was getting drained. This is not as easy as it seemed, I was giving all my energy every
time, and ran out of steam fast. Everyone told me how hard it was to enter the field, the job security was not
excellent, etc. This killed the spark, maybe it was time to look elsewhere.

Computational physics course
============================
Computers will solve all the problems in the world, I want to work with computers. The cool tricks I used to
do with my calculator, now I can do with much more power. I swore I would never follow my dad's footsteps, but
I ended up doing just that.
I quickly realized that a bachelor's degree in physics is not enough to land a decent job, so I pushed for a
master's, despite already knowing this was not my calling. It felt like the right path. Was it a mistake?
Should I have studied software engineering? Maybe, I will never know. Probably, I say. But hindsight is 20/20:
you cannot feel bad for doing what felt like the courageous choice at the time. When you have the choice,
better feel courageous in defeat than foolish: that would be like losing the same fight twice.

Landing a job at CONTXTFUL
==========================
Was not even called CONTXTFUL at the time: Proximity HCI, Spillad, CONTXTFUL
I was excited to work on projects involving computers and no quantum mechanics. The specific of the project
mattered very little. I wanted to join the team because I trusted the one in charge (who is now my boss)
I messaged him every month, to stay in the loop, but also because my thesis due date was approaching and I had
no idea what company would accept me with my background. I had an interview at Morgan Stanley, and completely
flopped. CONTXTFUL felt like my best shot at working in software without going back to square one.

Writing this blog
=================
I'm still not entirely sure what to do with my life, but I have learned to embrace this feeling. It is what
gives me the curiosity to move forward and discover things that go beyond my own imagination. I now know when
something feels **right** for me, like writing this blog for example. There are certain activities that feel
effortless, so effortless in fact that at times the true struggle is to wait until after work to do them! At
that point, work stops becoming work and becomes a game. I'm all about games!



I have lots of friends in physics who are afraid they don't fit in the current state of the industry. To them,
I say: don't be afraid. You are not a failure if you are not one of the 10% PhDs who land a position in
academia, etc.

I was always aimed at doing physics or teaching
When I ended up doing it, the only thing I knew is that academic research was not for me.
Now I know I found my niche, and yet, I still feel like an impostor. The feeling never stops?
