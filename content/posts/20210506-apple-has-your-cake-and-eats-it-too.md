- Pro privacy, yet launch a product like the airtag, which creates problems way worse than e.g. Facebook
  advertising, sensor data gathering on their devices, etc
- Lets anyone develop for their platform, but has strict restrictions on the apple store (spotify calls it
  abusive power grab)
  - https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/21/spotify-app-store-restrictions-antitrust-hearing/
- They don't allow you to repair their devices


bottomline, Apple doesn't stand for anything other than money and control. It has become a parasite.

Christopher Phillips from https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-like-Apple-products:

Oh man — my favorite question!

I will take the heat, like a man, for what I am about to write.

From my experience — those who choose Apple products fit the following:

    BIG NUMBER ONE: Inferior knowledge of technology.
    Part of their ego is driven by status products.
    Easily swayed by brilliant false advertising.
    ‘Keeping up with the Jones’

Apple products cannot be upgraded (spare me on the RAM, please).

Apple consistently insists it created EVERYTHING that is new technology, and I mean everything.

Apple’s price tags far supersede the hardware used in their products.

Apple, like Starbucks, created their own Jargon to confuse consumers; examples:

    Retina Display. What is that? If you look at competing resolutions, they exceed the magical Retina Display!
    Now retired — but Apple always insulted its consumers, with their permission, as they approached the Genius Bar. This is basically calling you stupid.
    If it ‘Just Worked’ — why did they need a Genius Bar? NOTE: I once tasked every so-called Genius at their very ‘Bar’ and they flunked rudimentary technical knowledge. Just sayin’.
    Every rendition of every product (new generation) is practically the same. For such a so-called innovative company — where is the diversity (now there is a deep pun!)
    Did you know that in the 1980’s — Microsoft had a touchscreen, much like those used today, I believe they dubbed ‘Slate’? But you were led to believe that Apple invented the touch screen OS.
    Apple limits your ability to utilize what you purchased (again, at an astronomical price.) You cannot customize, upgrade, install 3rd party software, overclock — etc. that has always been a mainstay of technology.
    If you want to buy an app, song, movie, etc — you MUST buy it through their stores. This flies in the face of the free market.
    Steve Jobs was an abusive leader with zero technical knowledge. His job was to ensure it looked pretty. That’s the raw truth.
    Steve Jobs was a marketing SAVANT! How do I know? Look how many people are willing to buy inferior tech for outrageous prices! You were snowed.

Apple is pretty and from my point of view — its place in the market is for consumers who do not know how to work tech and need a guiding hand.

MYTH BUSTED: Apple products are very prone to viruses and malware.

I could go on — but I think I’ve beat this subject to death.

But I will end with this: Some Apple enthusiasts border on cult personality. Oh . . . if you have a dissenting opinion about Apple — prepare to get kicked in the shins.

We’ll talk about the Chinese sweatshop like conditions and suicide nets atop the manufacturing plants another time — but while those who snapped your iPad together are trying to swan dive from a 30-story roof: Enjoy your iPhone!

All the best.
