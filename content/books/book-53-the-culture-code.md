Quotes that stuck out to me:

1. (p. 70) What mattered most in creating a successful team had less to do with
   intelligence and experience and more to do with where the desks were
   located.
2. (p. 81) Deciding who's in & who's out is the most powerful signal any group
   sends.
3. (p. 122) Everything is done as a group. There is no greater sin than losing
   track of someone.
4. (p. 127) Tamp down selfish instincts that might make you the center of
   attention
5. (p. 141) The most important four words any leader can say: "I screwed that
   up."
6. (p. 145) Being bulnerable together is the only way a team can become
   invulnerable.
7. (p. 151) Discovery has to do with asking the right question the right way.
8. (p. 159) As a leader, ask your people 3 questions:
    1. What is one thing that I currently do that you'l like me to
    continue to do?
    2. What is one thing that I don't currently do frequently enough that
    you think I should do more often?
    3. What can I do to make you more effective?
9. (p. 161) Two critical moments happen early in a group's life: the
   first vulnerability and the first disagreement. These are doorways to
   two possible group paths: Are we about appearing strong or about
   exploring the landscape together? Are we about winning interactions
   or about learning together?
10. (p. 166) Creting habits of vulnerability requires a group to endure
    two discomforts: emotional pain and a sense of inefficiency.
1. (p. 193) One of the best measures of any group's culture is its
   learning velocity: how quickly it improves its performance of a new
   skill.
1. (p. 212) The road to success is paved with mistakes well-handled.
