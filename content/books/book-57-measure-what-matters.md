:star: Star quotes:

1. (p. 11) Writing goals down makes them real.
1. (p. 24) Stressing output is the key to increasing productivity while
   looking to increase activity can result in just the opposite.
1. (p. 37) "We will achieve a certain Objective _as measured by_ the
   following Key Results."
1. (p. 38) When you're really high up in management, you're teaching.
1. (p. 46) Bad companies are destroyed by crisis. Good companies survive
   them. Great companies are improved by them.
1. (p. 50) When you are tired of saying it, people are starting to hear
   it.
1. (p. 54) Don't allow the perfect be the enemy of the good. Done is
   better than perfect.
1. (p. 55) Completion of all key results _must_ result in attainment of
   the objective. If not, it's not an OKR.
1. (p. 88) Micromanagement is mismanagement.
1. (p. 114) If you share a goal that nobody sees [due to an overly
   complex communication system], is the system truly transparent?
1. (p. 119) Whenever a key result or objective becomes obsolete or
   impractical, feel free to end it midstream. There's no need to hold
   stubbornly to an outdated projection -- strike it from your list and
   move on. Our goals are servants to our purpose, not the other way
   around.
1. (p. 119) When an objective gets dropped before the end of the OKR
   interval, it's important to notify *everyone* who depends on it.
1. (p. 122) In evaluating OKR performance, objective data is enhanced by
   the goal setter's thoughtful, subjective judgement. For any given
   goal in a given quarter, there may be extenuating circumstances. A
   weak showing by the numbers might hide a strong effort, a strong one
   could be artificially inflated.
1. (p. 124) Where OKR scores pinpoint what went right or wrong in the
   work, and how the team might improve, self-assessments drive a
   superior goal-setting process for the next quarter. There are no
   judgements, only learning.
1. (p. 142) The reward of having met challenging goals is that you get
   to play again.
1. (p. 159) Engineers struggle with goal setting in two big ways: they
   hate crossing off anything they think is a good idea, and they
   habitually underestimate how long it takes to get things done.
1. (p. 175) Conversations, Feedback and Recognition give OKRs their
   human voice.
1. (p. 185) Start rating your meetings and meeting organizers.
1. (p. 211) When you know your company objectives like you know your
   last name, it's very calming.
1. (p. 244) If everything's at green, you failed. You needed bigger
   ambitions.
