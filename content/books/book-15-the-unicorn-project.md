ðŸ‘Ž - I would suggest to skip this new release and just read the original [Phoenix Project](/posts/2023/07/book-41-1-the-phoenix-project/). To me, this sequel unfortunately feels like a repeat with somehow less substance.

Read [the notes I took](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1umyl9LkYzkxpNseqCUfbv_9rRwbXID7L/view?usp=drive_link) from this book.
