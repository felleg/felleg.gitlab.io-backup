(Thank you Lidia Mansur for this recommendation!)

To me, mental health is the holy grail of our human world. I have done a year of
therapy last year, and it completely changed my life. If I had a magic
wand, I would change our culture to make therapy as well regarded as
hitting the gym.

:star: Star quotes:

1. (p. 35) You can't control the thoguhts that arrive in your mind. You can
   control what you do once they appear.
1. (p. 35) Notice how you can choose to focus in on a thought, like Jim
   Carrey putting the mask over his face (in the movie The Mask), or you
   can let it pass and wait for the next thought to arrive.
1. (p. 45) When dealing with low mood, focus on your personal values around
   health.

1. (p. 78) We protect ourselves from the psychological threat of shame
   by sabotaging a process before it gets started.
1. (p. 87) When the task ahead feels like a mountain to climb, you don't
   look up at the peak. You narrow your focus and set yourself the
   challenge to make it to that next ridge. When you get there, you
   allow yourself to absorb that feeling of being on your way. Then you
   go again.
1. (p. 88) A simple shift of language can help us turn towards
   gratitude. Try switching "I have to..." with "I get to..."
1. (p. 94) You cannot change what you cannot make sense of.

   overturn the destructive impact of poor sleep or diet and lack of
   physical activity.
1. (p. 117) [The Feeling Wheel](img/feeling-wheel.jpeg)
1. (p. 123) Listen carefully. Don't offer advice unless they ask for it.
   Reflect back what you hear them saying; let them know they are being
   heard and respected.
1. (p. 129) When we block one emotion, we tend to block them all. We can
   be left feeling hollow, numb and struggling to find meaning and to
   engage with life in the way we once did.
1. (p. 135) Acceptance is not an end point in grief. It might be
   fleeting moments in which you have found a way to live in this new
   reality.
1. (p. 158) Ruminating and churning over a nasty comment with no sense
   of how this can help you is just a continuation of the attack on your
   character.
1. (p. 147) Adding pressure to feel a certain way in a particular
   time-frame only adds pain and distress.
1. (p. 174) If we believe that mistakes and shortcomings should be met
   with humiliation and shame no matter what the intention, how do we
   ever begin to be OK with taking risks and making mistakes ourselves?
1. (p. 174) How other people respond to my failures does not provide an
   accurate assessment of my personality and worthiness as a human, but
   instad indicates how that person relates to failure.
1. (p. 175) Coming back from failure (resilience) cannot be dependent on others. We
   will take responsibility to tend to our wounds with compassion and
   dust ourselves off after a fall.
1. (p. 193) Every time we say no to something because of fear, we
   reconfirm our belief that it wasn't safe or that we couldn't handle
   it.
1. (p. 218) The best kinf od coach is not one who swoops in to rescue
   you, but one who is honest with you and encourages you to find the
   strength within yourself to move through difficult moments, so that
   you may discover your own strength.
1. (p. 224) Through the physicality of death destroys us, the idea of
   death saves us.

   this slows the heart rate and calms the body.

   the process of noticing when your mind shifts its focus and
   intentionally choosing to redirect that focus back to the present
   moment.
1. (p. 274) Concealing shame keeps it going.
1. (p. 278) Sometimes we are not happy because we are human and life is
   difficult a lot of the time.
1. (p. 311) When we play the blame game, nobody wins.
