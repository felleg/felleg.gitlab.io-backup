üëç - I did it. I read a full book on Kubernetes. Honestly, it is
difficult for me to comment about the book without first mentioning how
proud I am of myself of getting through it.

For people in the tech world, this shouldn't be a "difficult" book by
any means. It is a fairly straightforward introduction to the world of
Kubernetes, and at times goes in depth in some security and best
practices topics without going overboard (kudos to the author for
maintaining that delicate balance). However, Kubernetes has made me feel
like an impostor for about 6 years. I have never felt confident about
its intricacies, its objects, its configuration settings. To me
Kubernetes seemed so big that it felt hopeless -- kind of like trying to
learn to speak fluent Mandarin while maintaining my other real life
responsibilities.

Long story short, by finishing this book, I gained one solid notch of
self-confidence. I beat my learning anxiety. While I'm not entirely cured of
my fear of getting a Kubernetes configuration wrong, at least I now feel
comfortable having a conversation on the topic with anyone. And that, to
me, is priceless.

Read [the notes I took](/books/the-kubernetes-book.pdf) from this book.
