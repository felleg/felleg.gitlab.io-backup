As someone deeply involved in DevOps and automation within my current
role, I found it essential to acquaint myself with Ansible, an
open-source automation tool renowned for its applications in
configuration management, application deployment, task automation, and
orchestration.

What can I say about Ansible that probably hasn't been said a thousand
times before... It seems like a great tool to manage servers! I now
picture it as a perfect complement to the IaC tools I was previously
used to for managing Kubernetes applications (e.g. Pulumi). While it
allows for great extensibility, it feels like the design of Ansible
always keeps it as simple as possible. That is the best of both worlds.

As for the book, while I wouldn't classify it as a "riveting read", I
must say that it does a wonderful job as a guide post. The author did a
great job of always leaving useful links and hints about things you
might get use out of. In that sense, I expect that this will be a book
I'll come back to time and again for new ideas concerning Ansible.

In summary, if you're new to Ansible, this seems like a great place to
start. The learning curve of the book is smooth (assuming basic
familiarity with other mainstream DevOps tools) and the topics discussed
seem relevant.
