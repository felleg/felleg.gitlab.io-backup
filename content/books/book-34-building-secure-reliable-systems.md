üëç - This is a book I have been intimidated by since it came out. I am proud of myself for having finished it! I think it's more meant to be reference material than actual reading material, to be fair. [You can browse the HTLM version of this book online for free](https://google.github.io/building-secure-and-reliable-systems/raw/toc.html).

Read [the notes I took](/books/building-secure-and-reliable-systems.pdf) from this book.
