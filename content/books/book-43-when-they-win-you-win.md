üëçüëç - This book is a perfect companion for *Radical Candor* (#20), and I would have a hard time picking which one I preferred between the two. I often felt like this book put in words things I have been thinking deep down for a long time. I love how unafraid the author is of going against the grain and pushing ideas that he tested himself on the field. A personal highlight was the Life Story Conversation questions (p. 204). I took the time to answer them myself and it felt like I was having an actual session with Russ, it was wonderful. Just like *Radical Candor*, this is an easy recommend for anyone who has to deal with humans in the workplace.
