Recently, my colleague @Pierre-Francois Saint-Marc noticed I was reading *The 48 Laws of Power* and
asked me, "Are you sure you want to read something like this in public?"

I totally get where his question came from. Long before the book landed
in my hands, I was asking myself the same question. Would this book make
me a manipulator? Would it corrupt my soul and turn me into an evil,
untrustworthy politician? How will this book change me?

For one, this book made me better appreciate what power truly is. Power,
contrary to what I was lead to believe for the longest time, is neither
good nor bad. Like money, power simply amplifies what you already are,
because being powerful is getting people to act according to your
desires. For example, reading this book made me appreciate how truly powerful
our children are, despite not being in a "position of authority."

What I feared when I started this book was that the author would focus
on the reader and treat coldly the people who would become subjected to
the reader's newly-found power. Actually, if anything, it's power itself
that the book treats coldly. It explains the mechanics of acquiring
power, using power, and keeping power. While I wasn't a huge fan of the
early laws in the book -- the ones about acquiring power, which seem all
about manipulating each other -- I was fascinated by the later chapters,
notably law 46 ("Never appear too perfect") which discussed the
destructive power of envy.

I believe that, at multiple points and turns in my life, I have broken
every one of the 48 rules. In that sense, it felt like the author was
coaching me to learn from my mistakes, in order to guide me toward
living a life where I felt in control. I expect to use the teachings
from this book for many years to come.

:star: Star quotes:

1. (p. xxi) If deception is the most potent weapon in your arsenal, then
   patience in all things is your crucial shield. Patience will protect
   you from making moronic blunders.
1. (p. xxi) Power is a game, and in games you do not judge your opponents by
   their intentions but by the effect of their actions.
1. (p. 21) In seduction, set up conflicting signals, such as desire and
   indifference, and you not only throw them off the scent, you inflame
   their desire to possess you.
1. (p. 31) The more you say, the more likely you are to say something
   foolish.
1. (p. 33) A person who cannot control his words shows that he cannot
   control himself, and is unworthy of respect. Power cannot accrue to
   those who squander their treasure of words.
1. (p. 39) Even those who argue against fame still want the books they
   write against it to bear their name in the title and hope to become
   famous for despising it.
1. (p. 41) Your reputation inevitably increases your presence and
   exaggerates your strengths without your having to spend much energy.
   It can also create an aura around you that will instill respect, even
   fear.
1. (p. 47) The worst fate in the world for a man who yearns fame, glory,
   and, of course, power is to be ignored.
1. (p. 51) The mysterious cannot be grasped. And what cannot be seized
   and consumed creates power.
1. (p. 54) If you find yourself trapped, cornered and on the defensive
   in some situation, try a simple experiment: Do something that cannot
   be easily explained or interpreted.
1. (p. 65) The essence of power is the ability to keep initiative, to
   get others to react to *your* moves.
1. (p. 69) Demonstrate, do not explicate.
1. (p. 74) Never argue. Give only results.
1. (p. 85) The best you can hope for is that others will grow so
   dependent on you that you enjoy a kind of reverse dependence: Their
   need for you frees you.
1. (p. 98) Referencing past acts of generosity only irritates because
   it subtly asks the other to feel guilty and puts them under
   obligation.
1. (p. 130) You are shielded from your enemies by the crowd.
1. (p. 131) As the emperor withdrew deeper and deeper into the palace to
   protect himself, he slowly lost control of the realm.
1. (p. 134) Never imagine yourself so elevated that you can afford to
   cut yourself off from even the lowest echelons.
1. (p. 180) Learn to flatter indirectly by downplaying your own
   contribution.
1. (p. 181) By expressing modest admiration for other people's
   achievements, you paradoxically call attention to your own. The
   ability to express wonder and amazement, and seem like you mean it,
   is greatly valued.
1. (p. 186) Do not overstep your bounds. Do what you are assigned to do,
   to the best of your abilities, and never do more. To think that by
   doing more you are doing better is a common blunder.
1. (p. 186) If you are a crown-keeper, be a crown-keeper. Save your
   excess energy for when you are not in the court.
1. (p. 197) The key to keeping the audience on the edge of their seats
   is letting events unfold slowly, then speeding them up at the right
   moment, according to a pattern and tempo that you control.
1. (p. 217) Your listeners will make their own connections and see what
   they want to see.
1. (p. 217) Once people have begun to gather around you, two dangers
   will present themselves; boredom and skepticism. Boredom will make
   people go elsewhere; skepticism will allow them the distance to think
   rationally about whatever it is you are offering.
1. (p. 228) Hesitation puts obstacles in your path, boldness eliminates
   them.
1. (p. 235) Timidity has no place in the realm of power; you will often
   benefit, however, by being able to feign it.
1. (p. 240) The person who goes too far in his triumphs creates a
   reaction that inevitably leads to a decline.
1. (p. 272) One sign of weakness is that when you touch on it the person
   will often act like a child. Be on the lookout, then, for any
   behavior that should have been outgrown.
1. (p. 273) An overt trait often conceals its opposite. People who thump
   their chests are often big cowards a prudish exterior may hide a
   lascivious soul; the uptight are often screaming for adventure; the
   shy are dying for attention.
1. (p. 278) The stronger the passion, the more vulnerable the person.
1. (p. 290) Never make the mistake of thinking that you elevate yourself
   by humiliating people.
1. (p. 292) Power rarely ends up in the hands of those who start a
   revolution, or even of those who further it; power sticks to those
   who bring it to a conclusion.
1. (p. 295) Space we can recover, time never.
1. (p. 297) Success that is built up slowly and surely is the only kind
   that lasts.
1. (p. 300) Disdain things you cannot have: ignoring them is the best
   revenge.
1. (p. 305) The more interest you show, the more you repel the object of
   your desire. Uncontrollable desire makes you seem weak, unworthy,
   pathetic.
1. (p. 306) If there is something you want but realize you cannot have,
   the worst thing you can do is draw attention to your disappoint by
   complaining about it.
1. (p. 313) If you have to explain yourself your power is already in
   question.
1. (p. 346) Greed does not pay.
1. (p. 355) You are your own father. Do not let yourself spend years
   creating yourself only to let your guard down and allow the ghost of
   the past -- father, habit, history -- to sneak back in.
1. (p. 372) There is no more infuriating feeling than having your
   individuality ignored, your own psychology unacknowledged.
1. (p. 385) The goal of power is always to lower people's resistance to
   you. For this you need tricks, and one trick is to teach them a
   lesson.
1. (p. 394) Just as you cannot make people see the world your way, you
   cannot wrench them into the future with painful changes. They will
   rebel. If reform is necessary, anticipate the reaction against it and
   find ways to disguise the change and sweeten the poison.
1. (p. 398) A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its
   opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its
   opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is
   familiar with it.
1. (p. 398) The changes you make must seem less innovative than they
   are.
1. (p. 405) Of all the disorders of the soul, envy is the only one no
   one confesses to.
1. (p. 405) As you gain power, those below you will feel envious of
   *you*. They may not show it but it is inevitable.
1. (p. 406) The naturally perfect have to work the most to disguise
   their brilliance, displaying a defect or two to deflect envy before
   it takes root.
1. (p. 407) Subtly emphasize how lucky you have been, to make your
   happiness seem more attainable to other people, and the need for envy
   less acute. But be careful not to affect on false modesty that people
   can easily see through. This will only make them more envious.
1. (p. 407) Political power of any kind creates envy, and one of the
   best ways to deflect it before it takes root is to seem unambitious.
1. (p. 407) Disguise your power as a kind of self-sacrifice rather than a
   source of happiness and you make it seem less enviable. Emphasize
   your troubles and you turn a potential danger (envy) into a source of
   moral support (pity)
1. (p. 408) In some Arab countries, a man will avoid arousing envy by
   showing his wealth only on the inside of his home.
1. (p. 408) Do not try to help or do favors for those who envy you; they
   will think you are condescending to them.
1. (p. 408) Envy is the tax which all distinction must pay.
1. (p. 414) Success makes you feel invulnerable while also making you
   more hostile and emotional when people challenge your power. It makes
   you less able to adapt to circumstance. You come to believe your
   character is more responsible for your success than your strategizing
   and planning.
1. (p. 414) The greatest danger occurs at the moment of victory.
1. (p. 416) The wheel of fortune will hurtle you down as easily as up.
   If you prepare for the fall, it is less likely to ruin you when it
   happens.
1. (p. 416) The rhythm of power often requires an alternation of force
   and cunning. Too much force creates a counterreaction; too much
   cunning, no matter how cunning it is, becomes predictable.
1. (p. 417) There is no better time to stop and walk away than after a
   victory.
1. (p. 424) Where chess is linear and direct, the ancient game of go is
   closer to the kind of strategy that will prove relevant in a world
   where battles are fought indirectly, in vast, loosely connected
   areas. Its strategies are abstract and multidimensional, inhabiting a
   plane beyond time and space.
