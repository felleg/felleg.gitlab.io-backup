According to its front cover, *What Color Is Your Parachute* is *the*
world's most popular and bestselling career handbook. After reading it,
it's easy to see why. Here is a book that has been updated yearly since
1970, skipping only 3 years in total. I have never seen something like
this before. The combination of timeless wisdom about how knowing
oneself deeply will set you on the path to your dream job, and fresh
advice on how to correctly leverage the latest technologies to help your
search, is a powerful one.

I read the book as a curiosity. Even though right now I am happy to say
I have found a nice place to work, I was still looking for a job less
than 2 months ago. The questions I was trying to answer while reading
this book were: 1) Was there some hint I could have used during my job
search? 2) Am I tackling the right field of work for my skills and
interests? 3) What makes this book so highly regarded?

You know what they say about job hunting: it's a full-time job in itself
(and a demanding one, at that). Reading this book feels like work. You
will be asked to get your notebook out and take some notes, write
stories, prioritize things, etc. It is a demanding book, in the sense
that it forces you to ask yourself questions you probably never
considered before. It asks of you to really dig deep in your soul and
tell yourself the truth about yourself.

The way it does this is through the Flower Exercise, a seven step
workshop where you must figure out what kind of people you want to work
with, what working conditions, what transferable skills you have, what
knowledge you possess, your desired salary range, your desired
geography, and finally your purpose in life. This forms the fabled
parachute. The theory is, if you keep these truths about yourself in
mind, you maximize your chances to accept a position that will fulfill
you. Dream big, but also, dream right.

The rest of the book is filled with neat advice, unwritten rules, and
above all, hope. If you're #jobhunting, if you're unsure of what your
next step should be, if you want to know what you are looking for, I
strongly recommend you give this book the time it asks of you. It's a
great investment.

Quotes that stuck out to me:

1. You are a person, not a job. (p. 104)
2. Instead of just hitting the "Invite" button on LinkedIn, *always*
   include a short personalized message. (p. 215)
3. Unlearn the idea that our unique Mission must consist of some
   achievement for all the world to see, and learn instead that as the
   stone does not always know what ripples it has caused in the pond
   whose surface it impacts, so neither we nor those who watch our life
   will always know what we have achieved by our life and by our
   Mission.
4. The place your Mission needs you is where your deep gladness and the
   world's deep hunger meet.
5. If you approach your job hunt as an opportunity to work on this issue
   as well as the issue of how you will keep body and soul together,
   then hopefully your job hunt will end with your being able to say,
   "Life has deep meaning to me now. I have discovered more than my
   ideal job. I have found my Mission, and the reason why I am here on
   Earth."
