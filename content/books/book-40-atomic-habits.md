üëç - I think this book greatly summarizes about 5 of the books I read so far. It's like "Mastery", "So Good, They Can't Ignore You", "Unlearn", "Psycho-Cybernetics", all rolled up into one. An easy recommend for someone interest in self-help.

Read [the notes I took](/books/atomic-habits.pdf) from this book.
