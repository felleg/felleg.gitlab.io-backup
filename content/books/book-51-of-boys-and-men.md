Quotes that stuck out to me:

1. When almost one in four boys (23%) is categorized as having a
   "developmental disability", it is fair to wonder if it is educational
   institutions, rather than boys, that aren't functioning properly. (p.
   8)
2. Life has not always been rosy for man in traditional families. There
   is a certain desolation in life that is designed for you, a potential
   hollowness. (p. 34)
3. The success of the women's movement has not caused the precariousness
   of male social identity, but it has exposed it. (p. 37)
4. The true cause of the male malaise is not a lack of labor force participation but
   cultural redundancy, a sense of purposelessness that has suicidal men
   describing themselves as useless and worthless. (p. 63)
5. "Ontological security" is exactly what many men are seeking; a more
   solid social anchor, more certainly about how to *be* in the world.
   (p. 67)
6. Culture has played a particularly important role in channeling the
   energy of men toward positive social ends, especially by teaching
   them to care for others. But this behavior, being leanred, is fragile
   and can disappear rather easily under social conditions that no
   longer teach it effectively. (p. 97)
7. Average differences between groups should never influence the
   treatment of individuals. (p. 98)
8. To be a grown-up means learning how to temper our own natures. The
   child is still in us, he is just not in charge anymore. (p. 102)
9. The "toxic masculinity" farming alienates the majority of
   non-violent, non-extreme men, and does little to address the
   grievances, or counteract the methods that lure susceptible
   individuals to the far right. (p. 108)
10. Natural differences between men and women have often been used to
    justify sexism. This is mostly an outdated fear. In recent years,
    most of the scientists identifying natural differences have, if
    anything, tended to stress the superiority of women. (p. 111)
11. The pandemic was bad for women in some ways, and bad for men in
    other ways. We can hold two thoughts in our head at the same time.
    (p. 114)
12. "Boys and men are struggling because the left hates them" is a
    powerful political message, because the first part is true, and the
    second part can be made to sound plausible given the tendency of
    many of the Left to pathologize masculinity. (p. 117)
13. Masculine supremacy, like white supremacy, was the neurosis of an
    immature society. It is good for men as well as women that women
    have been set free. That genie can enver be put back into the
    bottle. (p. 128)
14. The iron rule of politics is that if there are real problems in
    society, and responsible parties don'e deal with them, the
    irresponsible parties will jump on them. (p. 129)
15. When there are differences in starting conditions, treating the same
    (i.e. equally) is not the same as treating equitably. (p. 134)
16. An equitable education system will be one that recognizes natural
    sex differences, especially the fact that boys are at a
    developmental disadvantage to girls at critical points in their
    schooling. (p. 134)
17. If we are serious about expanding the role of fathers, equal leave
    is essential. The signal policy makers need to send is that paternal
    care matters as much as maternal care. Anything short of full
    equality blunts that message. (p. 175)
