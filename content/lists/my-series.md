I love how this show manages to capture the various angles of what it takes to build and maintain a winning team that can get you on top of the podium! |
| 2022 | 2016 | {{< thumbnail src="img/series/the-good-place.png" >}} | [The Good Place](https://www.justwatch.com/ca/tv-show/the-good-place) | < 1 |  Science-Fiction, Comedy, Drama, Fantasy, Romance | :x: Incredible premise, abysmal execution. Who is the target audience for this show? Hard pass for me. |
| 2022 | 2019 | {{< thumbnail src="img/series/chernobyl.png" >}} | [Chernobyl](https://www.justwatch.com/ca/tv-show/chernobyl) | 1 | Drama, History| :green_circle: Immensely sad. Great cautionary tale about the pitfalls of authoritarian organizations. |
| 2022 | 2019 | {{< thumbnail src="img/series/the-last-of-us.png" >}} | [The Last of Us](https://www.justwatch.com/ca/tv-show/the-last-of-us) | 1 | Drama, Science-Fiction, Mystery & Thriller, Action & Adventure, Horror| :green_circle: A great display of how humans and interactions self organize in the face of immense adversity. |
| 2022 | 2015 | {{< thumbnail src="img/series/better-call-saul.png" >}} | [Better Call Saul](https://www.justwatch.com/ca/tv-show/better-call-saul) | 6 | Crime, Drama | :green_circle: Greatest TV show of all time?|
| 2022 | 2022 | {{< thumbnail src="img/series/too-hot-to-handle.png" >}} | [Too Hot to Handle](https://www.justwatch.com/ca/tv-show/too-hot-to-handle) | 1 | "Reality TV", "Romance"| :x: I don't know what I was expecting when I decided to watch this, but I got what I deserved. Pure trash.|
| 2021 | 2007 | {{< thumbnail src="img/series/mad-men.png" >}} | [Mad Men](https://www.justwatch.com/ca/tv-show/mad-men) |  4 | Drama| :green_circle: A great example of how pathological organizations destroy lives. |
| 2021 | 2021 | {{< thumbnail src="img/series/squid-game.png" >}} | [Squid Game](https://www.justwatch.com/ca/tv-show/squid-game) | 1 |  Action & Adventure, Drama, Mystery & Thriller | :x: I enjoyed the striking visuals greatly. However, I think there was a missed opportunity to make a more nuanced statement on the wealth gap affecting our modern societies. |
| 2021 | 2017 | {{< thumbnail src="img/series/la-casa-de-papel.png" >}} | [La Casa de Papel](https://www.justwatch.com/ca/tv-show/paperhouse) | 2 | Crime, Drama, Mystery & Thriller, Action & Adventure, Made in Europe  | :x: Great to see a Spanish series getting major attention. It's a shame that its plot lives in a fantasy world, though. Why is this so popular? |
| 2020 | 2010 | {{< thumbnail src="img/series/the-walking-dead.png" >}} | [The Walking Dead](https://www.justwatch.com/ca/tv-show/the-walking-dead) | 9 |  Action & Adventure, Drama, Science-Fiction, Horror, Mystery & Thriller | :yellow_square: This felt a little too real to watch in the middle of the pandemic! It dealt with interesting moral issues. I now listen to [Easy Street](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDnva_3fcTc) when it's time to do chores. Unfortunately, the show started to drag on around season 4.|
| 2020 | 2020 | {{< thumbnail src="img/series/tiger-king.png" >}} | [Tiger King](https://www.justwatch.com/ca/tv-show/tiger-king-murder-mayhem-and-madness) | 2 |  Documentary, Crime | :green_circle: Surreal. When the pandemic hit and it felt like the world was ending, it felt great to destress by laughing at other people's problems. The show is actually a great depiction of the dangers of miscommunications and not keeping one's ego in check. |
| 2019 | 2017 (the show got rebooted, previous seasons don't count) | {{< thumbnail src="img/series/occupation-double.png" >}} | [Occupation Double](https://www.justwatch.com/ca/tv-show/occupation-double) | 6 |  Reality TV | :green_circle: In my opinion, this is the greatest reality TV show of all time. I feel like it's only a matter of time before the concept gets replicated in other parts of the world. What puts this show above other reality TV shows is that it feels like the production team genuinely cares about the wellbeing of its contestants. It really is a microworld in which behaviors and situations happen organically and unpredictably. It is fascinating, and I applaud everyone working on the show despite the controversies that it may generate. As a society, we need shows like this to evolve. |
| 2018 | 2013 | {{< thumbnail src="img/series/rick-and-morty.png" >}} | [Rick and Morty](https://www.justwatch.com/ca/tv-show/rick-and-morty) | 4 |   Comedy, Science-Fiction, Action & Adventure, Animation | :green_circle: Both seriously funny and thought provoking. This show doesn't take itself seriously, despite how clever it is. Refreshing. High IQ required (?)|
| 2018 | 2011 | {{< thumbnail src="img/series/black-mirror.png" >}} | [Black Mirror](https://www.justwatch.com/ca/tv-show/black-mirror) | 1 |  Science-Fiction, Mystery & Thriller, Drama, Made in Europe | :green_circle: The modern Twilight Zone. This show is a treasure of science-fiction writing. It shows the very real pitfalls of technological advances such as social networking in a credible/plausible way.  |
| 2017 | 2017 | {{< thumbnail src="img/series/el-chapo.png" >}} | [El Chapo](https://www.justwatch.com/ca/tv-show/el-chapo  ) | 2 |   Drama, Action & Adventure, Crime, History | :green_circle: I love watching shows about drug cartels because it is a great display of the systemic issues that plague complex systems. Add a charismatic leader at the top, El Chapo, and you've got a solid show.|
| 2016 | 2015 | {{< thumbnail src="img/series/narcos.png" >}} | [Narcos](https://www.justwatch.com/ca/tv-show/narcos) | 2 |  Drama, Crime, Mystery & Thriller, History | :green_circle: My favorite "drug cartel" series, right after Breaking Bad. |
| 2016 | 2005 | {{< thumbnail src="img/series/prison-break.png" >}} | [Prison Break](https://www.justwatch.com/ca/tv-show/prison-break) | 2 | Action & Adventure, Drama, Mystery & Thriller, Crime, Made in Europe | :x: I don't remember much about this show. Bland and forgettable indeed. |
| 2016 | 2008 | {{< thumbnail src="img/series/breaking-bad.png" >}} | [Breaking Bad](https://www.justwatch.com/ca/tv-show/breaking-bad) | 5 | Crime, Drama | :green_circle: Greatest TV show of all time?|
| 2015 | 2010 | {{< thumbnail src="img/series/adventure-time.png" >}} | [Adventure Time](https://www.justwatch.com/ca/tv-show/season-1) | 10 | Science-Fiction, Animation, Comedy, Action & Adventure, Kids & Family, Fantasy | :green_circle: A fun goofy show that at times unpredictably tackles real-world issues. I think this show is a safe pick for both adults and children. Adventure Time is a good time.|
