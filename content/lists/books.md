I have [rediscovered the joy of learning through reading
books](/posts/2022/08/overcoming-learning-anxiety/). The product of
these lectures are notes written by hand. These are the notes shared on
this page. I want to share them for two reasons:

- this constitutes a personal backup copy in case I lose my notebook
- this could be useful to someone who wants a summary of the main ideas
 (that jumped at me) in a specific book.

I find it interesting to notice the evolution of my note-taking patterns
over time. Never stop learning, especially while learning! "You are never
the best at being better."

| 41 (& 1)| [My Notes](/books/the-phoenic-project.pdf) | The Phoenix Project (Gene Kim et. al) | {{< thumbnail src="img/books/phoenix-project.jpg" position="center" >}} | 2014 | TBD | TBD |
| 40| [My Notes](/books/atomic-habits.pdf) | Atomic Habits (James Clear) | {{< thumbnail src="img/books/atomic-habits.jpg" position="center" >}} | 2018 | 2023-07-24 | 👍 - I think this book greatly summarizes about 5 of the books I read so far. It's like "Mastery", "So Good, They Can't Ignore You", "Unlearn", "Psycho-Cybernetics", all rolled up into one. An easy recommend for someone interest in self-help. |
| 39| [My Notes](/books/thinking-in-systems.pdf) | Thinking in Systems (Donella H. Meadows) | {{< thumbnail src="img/books/thinking-in-systems.jpg" position="center" >}} | 2008 | 2023-07-19 | 👍👍 - This 185 pages-long book is pure meat. No fat. The work of a lifetime of thinking about systems and how they affect our world. In particular, this really connected with my Physicist brain. Systems thinking gives us the "formulas" that govern "the systems" in which we live. I will think about the concepts taught in this book for years to come. Essential read for any manager! |
| 38| [My Notes](/books/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you.pdf) | So Good They Can't Ignore You (Cal Newport) | {{< thumbnail src="img/books/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you.jpg" position="center" >}} | 2016 | 2023-07-12 | 👍 - This is the fastest book I have ever read! I really enjoyed it: short, to the point, and with lovely ideas that feel great to think about. To me it confirmed that I am currently on the right path to become "so good they can't ignore me." I have identified my mission ("build a learning organization to tap into the human potential") and I feel like I am building my career capital by learning how to learn. Overall, this book felt like a nice pat on the back, and I think like it can be inspiring for someone who might be as lost as I was when I started my career. (Thanks Ricardo for this recommendation!)  |
| 37| [My Notes](/books/reinventing-organizations.pdf) | Reinventing Organizations (Frédéric Laloux) | {{< thumbnail src="img/books/reinventing-organizations.jpg" position="center" >}} | 2014 | 2023-07-11 | 👍 - Terrific ideas. This book inspires me to try to show what management can change to tap into the unexplored potential that lives in every human. I think every C-level manager should explore the ideas discussed in this book and see if they resonate with them. This is the future of work. |
| 36| n/a | Le Petit Larousse (collectif) | {{< thumbnail src="img/books/larousse-2024.jpg" position="center" >}} | 2023 | Never | 👍👍 - J'adore ouvrir ce dictionnaire à une page aléatoire et lire sur tout ce qui attire mon attention. Ce livre est un trésor oublié, un joyau qui vit dans une classe à part. Selon moi, il représente ce qui peut être accompli par une "organisation apprenante" (learning organization). P.S.: "[The fold is strong with this one!](/img/larousse-fold.jpg)" |
| 35| [My Notes](/books/the-fifth-discipline.pdf) | The Fifth Discipline (Peter M. Senge) | {{< thumbnail src="img/books/the-fifth-discipline.jpg" position="center" >}} | 1990 | 2023-07-02 | 👍👍 - When it comes to business management, I believe this is one of the most important publications of all time. The Fifth Discipline contains just about everything you need to start thinking about in order to create your own learning organization. In particular, it taught me about "systems thinking" and "microworlds", which are concepts that I now keep top of mind when thinking about systemic issues in any dimension of life (from work to family life, and everything in between). A great book not to be missed, still as fresh today as it was in 1990. |
| 34| [My Notes](/books/building-secure-and-reliable-systems.pdf) | Building Secure & Reliable Systems (Heather Adkins et al.) | {{< thumbnail src="img/books/building-secure-and-reliable-systems.jpg" position="center" >}} | 2020 | 2023-06-26 | 👍 - This is a book I have been intimidated by since it came out. I am proud of myself for having finished it! I think it's more meant to be reference material than actual reading material, to be fair. [You can browse the HTLM version of this book online for free](https://google.github.io/building-secure-and-reliable-systems/raw/toc.html). |
| 33| [My Notes](/books/unlearn.pdf) | Unlearn (Barry O'Reilly) | {{< thumbnail src="img/books/unlearn.jpg" position="center" >}} | 2018 | 2023-06-05 | 👍 - My favorite quote: "To attain knowledge, add things every day. To attain wisdom, remove things every day." |
| 32| n/a | Mon Cerveau a encore besoin de lunettes (Dre Annick Vincent) | {{< thumbnail src="img/books/mon-cerveau-a-encore-besoin-de-lunettes.jpg" position="center" >}} | 2022 | 2023-05-24 | 👍 - Je crois que j'ai un TDA...? |
| 31| [My Notes](/books/mastery.pdf) | Mastery (Robert Greene) | {{< thumbnail src="img/books/mastery.png" position="center" >}} | 2012 | 2023-05-15 | 👍 - Reading this was an almost religious experience. As I was taking my notes, I could feel myself going through some of the mental steps and blockages outlined in the book. This was probably my most challenging read yet, as it truly tested my reading system. Now that I made it through, I feel stronger than ever. What a ride! (Thanks Marcel for this recommendation!) |
| 30| [My Notes](/books/the-fearless-organization.pdf) | The Fearless Organization (Amy C. Edmondson) | {{< thumbnail src="img/books/the-fearless-organization.png" position="center" >}} | 2018 | 2023-05-08 | 👍👍 - Incredibly relevant. I want to work for an organization that values psychological safety. The author makes it clear that it is one of the best investments money can't buy. |
| 29| [My Notes](/books/execution.pdf) | Execution (Larry Bossidy & Ram Charan) | {{< thumbnail src="img/books/execution.jpg" position="center" >}} | 2002 | 2023-04-28 | 🤔 - Has some useful quotes, but I don't know what to think about the book itself. This is aimed at CEOs in manufacturing in the 2000s. I wonder how relevant some parts of the book are in today's reality. (Thanks Karim for this recommendation!)|
| 28| [My Notes](/books/the-hard-thing-about-hard-things.pdf) | The Hard Thing About Hard Things (Ben Horowitz) | {{< thumbnail src="img/books/the-hard-thing-about-hard-things.jpg" position="center" >}} | 2014 | 2023-04-22 | 👍 - Gives good insight about how it feels like to live the reality of a CEO. |
| 27| n/a | Dis-moi qui tu aimes, je te dirai qui tu es (Marc Pistorio) | {{< thumbnail src="img/books/dis-moi.jpg" position="center" >}} | 2017 | 2023-04-17 | 👍 |
| 26| [My Notes](/books/start-with-why.pdf) | Start With Why (Simon Sinek) | {{< thumbnail src="img/books/start-with-why.jpg" position="center" >}} | 2009 | 2023-04-18 | 👍👍 - Truly inspiring. The book made me realize the importance of aligning WHAT we do with WHY we do it. |
| 25| [My Notes](/books/sooner-safer-happier.pdf) | Sooner Safer Happier (Jonathan Smart) | {{< thumbnail src="img/books/sooner-safer-happier.png" position="center" >}} | 2020 | 2023-04-14 | 👍👍 - Mind-blowing. Incredible. Reading this felt exactly like reading *The DevOps Handbook* for the first time. What I love about BVSSH is that there are no buzzwords to get confused about: this is simply solid advice that every organization should follow. |
| 24| [My Notes](/books/influence.pdf) | Influence (Robert Cialdini) | {{< thumbnail src="img/books/influence.jpg" position="center" >}} | 1984 (revised 2007) | 2023-04-07 | 👍 - A bit too long-winded for its own good, *Influence* still contains powerful insight about what influences our decisions. (Thanks Dan for this recommendation!) |
| 23| [My Notes](/books/psycho-cybernetics.pdf) | Psycho-Cybernetics (Maxwell Maltz) | {{< thumbnail src="img/books/psycho-cybernetics.png" position="center" >}} | 1960 (revised 2015) | 2023-04-04 | 👍 - Great tips about how to form a mental self-image. "You can do anything you set your mind to." (Thanks Dan for this recommendation!) |
| 22| [My Notes](/books/shape-up.pdf) | Shape Up (Ryan Singer) | {{< thumbnail src="img/books/shape-up.png" position="center" >}} | 2019 | 2023-03-14 | 👍👍 -- Really clever framework that has the potential to replace Agile and Scrum. I hope I'll get to try it out someday. Everything just clicks! [This book is also available online for free](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) (Thanks Benoit for this recommendation!) |
| 21| [My Notes](/books/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people.pdf) | How to Win Friends & Influence People (Dale Carnegie) | {{< thumbnail src="img/books/how-to-win-friends.png" position="center" >}} | 1936 (revised 1981) | 2023-03-07 | 👍 -- Groundbreaking for its time, and still relevant today. Good tips about how to listen to people and get them to think about your ideas. (Thanks Raymond for this recommendation!) |
| 20| [My Notes](/books/radical-candor.pdf) | Radical Candor (Kim Scott) | {{< thumbnail src="img/books/radical-candor.jpg" position="center" >}} | 2019 | 2023-02-28 | 👍👍 -- Essential reading for anyone who has to interact with a manager or employees on a daily basis! (Thanks Anthony for this recommendation!) |
| 19| [My Notes](/books/accelerate.pdf) | Accelerate (Nicole Forsgren PhD) | {{< thumbnail src="img/books/accelerate.jpg" position="center" >}} | 2018 | 2023-01-24 | 👍 -- The science behind the ideas that were first featured in the DevOps Handbook. A much appreciated look behind the curtain. |
| 18| [My Notes](/books/building-successful-communities.pdf) | Building Successful Communities of Practice (Emily Webber) | {{< thumbnail src="img/books/building-successful-communities.jpg" position="center" >}} | 2016 | 2023-01-14 | 👍 |

| 16| [My Notes](/books/making-work-visible.pdf) | Making Work Visible (Dominica DeGrandis) | {{< thumbnail src="img/books/making-work-visible.jpg" position="center" >}} | 2022 | 2022-12-03 | 👍 |
| 15| [My Notes](/books/the-unicorn-project.pdf) | The Unicorn Project (Gene Kim) | {{< thumbnail src="img/books/the-unicorn-project.png" position="center" >}} | 2019 | 2022-10-30 | 👎 - Skip this and just read The Phoenix Project... This feels like a repeat with somehow less substance.|
