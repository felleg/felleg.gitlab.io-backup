title: "My Lectures"
---

I have [rediscovered the joy of learning through reading
books](/posts/2022/08/overcoming-learning-anxiety/). The product of
these lectures are notes written by hand. These are the notes shared on
this page. I shared them for two reasons:

- it constitutes a personal backup copy in case I lose my notebook
- it could be useful to someone who wants a summary of the main ideas
  (that jumped at me) in a specific book.

I find it interesting to notice the evolution of my note-taking patterns
over time. Never stop learning, especially while learning!
