title: "My Arcade High Scores"
---

Long live the arcade! I use this page to track my high scores at different
games I enjoy. I find great joy in managing to push the boundaries of my
reflexes and gaming skills. If you feel competitive, you are welcome to try these
games and beat my high scores (in fact, I dare you)!

All scores were performed on a [MiSTer FPGA](/posts/2020/10/dream-machine-mister-fpga/) (unless stated otherwise).
