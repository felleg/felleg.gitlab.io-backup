title: "Shmups to Try If You Like Zeroranger"
---

[ZeroRanger](https://store.steampowered.com/app/809020/ZeroRanger/) is a
video game that took many gamers by surprise. It is a 2D shoot 'em up that
manages to appeal to both a niche audience and newcomers to the genre. It
mixes stylish visuals with storytelling that is frankly too good for an
action game without dialogue.

A shmup newcomer [on
Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/shmups/comments/tgux9v/zeroranger_one_of_the_best_shmups_ever_made/i153qw5/?context=3)
wondered about other shmups to try, since ZeroRanger made them realize how
great shmups could be. Thus, here are the games I would suggest to try if
you too enjoyed ZeroRanger and want more:
