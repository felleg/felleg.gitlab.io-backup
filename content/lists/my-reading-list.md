I have [rediscovered the joy of learning through reading
books](/posts/2022/08/overcoming-learning-anxiety/). The product of
these lectures are notes written by hand. These are the notes shared on
this page. I want to share them for two reasons:

- this constitutes a personal backup copy in case I lose my notebook
- this could be useful to someone who wants a summary of the main ideas
 (that jumped at me) in a specific book.

I find it interesting to notice the evolution of my note-taking patterns
over time. Never stop learning, especially while learning! "You are never
the best at being better."

| 32| [My Notes (wip)](/lectures/unlearn.pdf) | Unlearn (Barry O'Reilly) | {{< thumbnail src="img/lectures/unlearn.jpg" >}} | 2018 | TBD | TBD |
| 31| n/a | Mon Cerveau a encore besoin de lunettes (Dre Annick Vincent) | {{< thumbnail src="img/lectures/mon-cerveau-a-encore-besoin-de-lunettes.jpg" >}} | 2022 | 2023-05-24 | 👍 - Je crois que j'ai un TDA... |
| 30| [My Notes](/lectures/mastery.pdf) | Mastery (Robert Greene) | {{< thumbnail src="img/lectures/mastery.png" >}} | 2012 | 2023-05-15 | 👍 - Reading this was an almost religious experience. As I was taking my notes, I could feel myself going through some of the mental steps and blockages outlined in the book. This was probably my most challenging read yet, as it truly tested my reading system. Now that I made it through, I feel stronger than ever. What a ride! (Thanks Marcel for this recommendation!) |
| 29| [My Notes](/lectures/the-fearless-organization.pdf) | The Fearless Organization (Amy C. Edmondson) | {{< thumbnail src="img/lectures/the-fearless-organization.png" >}} | 2018 | 2023-05-08 | 👍👍 - Incredibly relevant. I want to work for an organization that values psychological safety. The author makes it clear that it is one of the best investments money can't buy. |
| 28| [My Notes](/lectures/execution.pdf) | Execution (Larry Bossidy & Ram Charan) | {{< thumbnail src="img/lectures/execution.jpg" >}} | 2002 | 2023-04-28 | 🤔 - Has some useful quotes, but I don't know what to think about the book itself. This is aimed at CEOs in manufacturing in the 2000s. I wonder how relevant some parts of the book are in today's reality. (Thanks Karim for this recommendation!)|
| 27| [My Notes](/lectures/the-hard-thing-about-hard-things.pdf) | The Hard Thing About Hard Things (Ben Horowitz) | {{< thumbnail src="img/lectures/the-hard-thing-about-hard-things.jpg" >}} | 2014 | 2023-04-22 | 👍 - Gives good insight about how it feels like to live the reality of a CEO. |
| 26| n/a | Dis-moi qui tu aimes, je te dirai qui tu es (Marc Pistorio) | {{< thumbnail src="img/lectures/dis-moi.jpg" >}} | 2017 | 2023-04-17 | 👍 |

| 24| [My Notes](/lectures/sooner-safer-happier.pdf) | Sooner Safer Happier (Jonathan Smart) | {{< thumbnail src="img/lectures/sooner-safer-happier.png" >}} | 2020 | 2023-04-14 | 👍👍 - Mind-blowing. Incredible. Reading this felt exactly like reading *The DevOps Handbook* for the first time. What I love about BVSSH is that there are no buzzwords to get confused about: this is simply solid advice that every organization should follow. |
| 23| [My Notes](/lectures/influence.pdf) | Influence (Robert Cialdini) | {{< thumbnail src="img/lectures/influence.jpg" >}} | 1984 (revised 2007) | 2023-04-07 | 👍 - A bit too long-winded for its own good, *Influence* still contains powerful insight about what influences our decisions. (Thanks Dan for this recommendation!) |
| 22| [My Notes](/lectures/psycho-cybernetics.pdf) | Psycho-Cybernetics (Maxwell Maltz) | {{< thumbnail src="img/lectures/psycho-cybernetics.png" >}} | 1960 (revised 2015) | 2023-04-04 | 👍 - Great tips about how to form a mental self-image. "You can do anything you set your mind to." (Thanks Dan for this recommendation!) |

Good tips about how to listen to people and get them to think about your ideas. (Thanks Raymond for this recommendation!) |
| 19| [My Notes](/lectures/radical-candor.pdf) | Radical Candor (Kim Scott) | {{< thumbnail src="img/lectures/radical-candor.jpg" >}} | 2019 | 2023-02-28 | 👍 -- Essential reading for anyone who has to interact with a manager or employees on a daily basis! |
