I had forgotten how much I enjoyed Christopher Nolan's movies, it seems. I
am currently watching [The Prestige](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prestige_(film)) and am having an absolute blast. Certainly, this is shaping up to be one of the most entertaining movies I've seen in my lifetime.

How did I come across it? It's because it was mentioned in a Netflix
documentary I viewed about an hour earlier:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_No_One:_The_Hunt_for_the_Crypto_King.
In the documentary, the mention in passing Christopher Nolan's The
Prestige (2006). Having realized that I had not watched that movie yet,
I found a copy online and spent the next hours watching. All I can say
is that I am absolutely gobsmacked at the quality of what I'm seeing so
far. This is a perfect little scam movie, just like Quadriga's story is
also the perfect real-world scam.

I hate scam as much as the next guy, but in the effort to see the
positive in worst things: when something is truly perfect, you have to
at least mention that.

At 23m03s in the movie, I want to say that the old magician (played by
Sir Micheal Caine) is definitely part of the scam and will leave with
the thieves, whatever it is they get away with. There are so many
reasons for this to be the case.

Let's see if I'm right.

So far, 5/5 movie.

P.S.: This movie shows why programmers love computers. Computers don't lie.
