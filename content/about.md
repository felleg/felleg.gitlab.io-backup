Hi there! :wave: My name is FÃ©lix.

{{< figure src="/img/felixleger.png" caption="This is me!" position="center" >}}

When I was in primary school, I knew I wanted to become a writer.

When I was in highschool, I knew I wanted to become a teacher.

When I was attending Cegep, I knew I wanted to become a physics teacher.

But then... as I was studying physics in college, a numerical physics course showed me the real power of
computers. I fell in love.

By writing this blog, I am doing everything I love at once. I write about lessons I learned while
experimenting with technology, and other fun parts of life.
