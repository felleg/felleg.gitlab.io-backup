Hi there! :wave: My name is Félix. I live in Montreal, Quebec. Je parle français à la maison, and English at work.
Thanks for visiting my website!

This is my personal space where I discuss things that spark my interest. I hope I will find a way to make them
interesting to you.

If you resonate with anything you find here, I hope you will let me
know in a Disqus comment or via email. :smile: In the meantime, have a nice day!
