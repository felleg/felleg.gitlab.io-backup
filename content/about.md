Hi there! :wave: My name is Félix. I live in Montreal, Quebec. Je parle français à la maison (I speak French at home), and English at work.
Thanks for visiting my website!

If you resonate with anything you find here, I hope you will let me
know in a comment or via email. :smile: In the meantime, have a nice day!
