Hi there! :wave: My name is Félix. I live in Montreal, Quebec. Je parle français à la maison (I speak French at home), and English at work.
Thanks for visiting my website!

My hobby is reading and writing. I have written a book titled
[Overcoming Learning Anxiety](https://felx.cc/ola-store), which you
can preview [here](https://felx.cc/ola).

I have also reviewed {{< n_books >}} books, which you
can browse by visiting my [digital bookshelf](/bookshelf)

If you resonate with anything you find here, I hope you will let me
know in a comment or via email. I also have a [guestbook](/guestbook) you can sign. :smile: In the meantime, have a nice day!
