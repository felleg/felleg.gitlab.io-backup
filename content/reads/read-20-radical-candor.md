# :star: Star quotes

1. (p. xxviii) Relationships may not scale (Dunbar's number), but
   culture does.
1. (p. 24) The problem with living at the top of a hill is that you
   always have to walk uphill just to get back home.
1. (p. 90) While ideas can ultimately be very powerful, they begin as
   fragile, barely formed thoughts easily missed, compromised and
   squished.  It's tempting to shut these down ("I don't have time right
   now!"), but taking the time to clarify the ideas will save time in
   the long run.
1. (p. 92) **Plussing**: A technique, where rather than saying 'No,
   that's a bad idea', people must offer a solution to the problem they
   see in an idea. This technique is used at Pixar.
1. (p. 132) To get over the awkwardness of asking your direct reports
   what they think of your performance, have a go-to question, e.g.
   "What could I do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with
   me?"
1. (p. 134) You may disagree with criticism, if you:
    1. First, find something in the criticism you can agree with to
       signal you're open to criticism.
    1. Then, make sure you understand what they mean by repeating.
    1. Then, let them know what you think about what  they said and
       schedule time to talk about it again.
1. (p. 152) Listen, challenge, commit. A strong leader has the humility
   to listen, the confidence to challenge, and the wisdom to know when
   to quit arguing and to get on board.
1. (p. 212) The only people required to participate in big debate should
   be those you identified in your staff meeting. But anyone should be
   able to attend/observe the big debate meeting. The debate "owner"
   appoints somebody to take notes and send them out to all relevant
   parties.
