Terrific ideas. This book inspires me to try to show what management can
change to tap into the unexplored potential that lives in every human. I
think every C-level manager should explore the ideas discussed in this
book and see if they resonate with them. This is the future of work.

# :star: Star quotes

1. (p. 49) In earlier stages, when we disagree with other people, we
   often meet them in judgement, believing that we must be right and
   they must be wrong. Or we can, in the name of tolerance (the Green
   ideal), gloss over our differences and affirm that all truths are
   equally valid. In Tail, we can transcend this polarity and integrate
   with the higher truth of non-judgement -- we can examine our belief
   and find to be superior in truth *and* yet embrace the other as a
   human being of fundamentally equal value.
1. (p. 49) :star: We are rich not through the things we own, but through the
   relationships that nourish our soul.
1. (p. 67) The basis for decision-making is *not* consensus. For a
   solution to be adopted, it is enough that nobody has a principled
   objection. A person cannot veto a decision because she feels another
   solution (for example, hers!) would have been preferable.
1. (p. 77) Traditional pyramidal structures demand too much of too few
   and not enough of everyone else.
1. (p. 81) "My colleagues are honorable men and women, and they prove it
   every day by their actions in a workplace where they're at liberty to
   run amok if they're so inclined. They're just not so inclined, that's
   all. The exceptions are so rare that to clamp heavy restrictions on
   the whole work force just to try to control the actions of the
   potential bad apples would be a colossal self-sabotage."
1. (p. 91) At FAVE, a simple but powerful relief valve exists, should a
   team leader find the taste of power too sweet: workers can choose at
   any moment to join another team. If a team leaders start to behave
   autocratically, people can simply walk away.
1. (p. 100) :star: **The advice process**: any person in the
   organization can make any decision, but before doing so, **must**
   seek advice from all affected parties and people with expertise on
   the matter.
1. (p. 108) People:
    - Are creative, thoughtful, trustworthy adults, capable of making
      important decisions
    - Are accountable and responsible for their decisions and actions
    - Are fallible. We make mistakes, sometimes on purpose
    - Are unique
    - Want to use their collective talents and skills to make a positive
      contribution to the organization and the world.
1. (p. 110) We reap what we saw: fear breeds fear and trust breeds
   trust. Traditional hierarchies and their plethora of built-in control
   systems are, at their core, formidable machines that breed fear and
   distrust.
1. (p. 113) Two principles (basic social values) should inspire every
   management practice:
    - Individuals should never use force against other people
    - Individuals should honor their commitments
