# Review

Here's an original book, to say the least. I must be honest, at one
point I thought of giving this one a :-1:. It was too all over the
place, I thought. It didn't seem to focus on its subject matter: who
are originals, where do they come from, and how they work to make the
world a better place.

My initial reaction was most surprising to myself, considering the book
sits at 4.5 stars on Amazon with a very respectable 6,993 ratings. Now
that I have finished it and let the dust settle, my opinion of the book
softened a bit. Maybe it's me who wasn't paying enough attention to the
thread that was tying the book together. When I decided to review the
book based on the star quotes I got, and forgetting about the
expectations I had coming in, I realized that I did enjoy the book
enough to recommend it.

Just make sure to enter the book with an open mind. After finishing [The
48 Laws of Power](/book/book-55-the-48-laws-of-power/), I was expecting
another deep dive into the history of originals and the physics of how
they improve the world. What I got was a book that gave many ideas about
how to better listen to originals, whoever they may be.

# :star: Star quotes

1. (p. xii)  A friend is someone who sees more potential in you than you see
   in yourself, someone who helps you become the best version of
   yourself.
1. (p. 38) You gotta kiss a lot of frogs before you find a prince.
1. (p. 51) To be successfully original, an invention needs to be new --
   but it also has to be practical.
1. (p. 58) It's rare the originality comes from insiders, especially
   when they're as entrenched and comfortable as the optical industry.
1. (p. 59) Instead of limiting access to the ideas ans leaving it up to
   managers to decide which ones to pursur and implement, make
   suggestions completely transparent in a collaborative document (e.g.
   Google Docs). Everyone in the company can read them, comment on them
   online, and discuss them in a bi-weekly meeting.
   - This means that ideas are evaluated not only by managers, but also
     by fellow creators who tend to be more open to radically novel
     ideas.
1. (p. 59) To give employees some guidance on which suggestions
   represent strategic priorities for the company, managers vote the
   promosing ones up and the bad ones down. To avoid false positives and
   false negatives, the votes aren't biniding. Technology teams can
   overrule managers by selecting a request that didn't receive a lot of
   votes and work to prove its value.
1. (p. 67) As you gain respect for your efforts, you gain *idiosyncracy
   credits*: the latitude to deviate from the group's expectations.
1. (p. 74) The easier it is to think of somethiing, the more common and
   important we assume it is. We use ease of retrieval as information.
1. (p. 91) If we could do things over, most of us would censor ourselves
   less and express our ideas more.
1. (p. 112) Work like a sculptor modelling in clay who never accepts any
   form as final but goes on creating, even at the risk of obscuring his
   original intentions.
1. (p. 141) Originality is what everybody wants, but there's a sweet
   spot. The goal is to push the envelope, not tear the envelope.
1. (p. 152) By adopting the parenting practices that are typically
   applied primarily to younger children, we can raise any child to
   become more original.
1. (p. 167) Explanations for our impact on others are most likely to
   have a lasting effect if they're coupled with a statement of
   principles. "She's crying because she wants to play with your toys"
   doesn't do much good alone; the more meaningful statement is: "She's
   crying because she wants to play with your toys, and in this family
   we always share."
1. (p. 169) People are more likely to clean up when asked *to be
   helpers* instead of asking *to help*.
1. (p. 190) No one has the right to hold a critical opinion without
   speaking up about it.
1. (p. 201) Argue like you're right and listen like you're wrong.
1. (p. 205) The main purpose of values is to help people choose between
   conflicting options. The relative importance of multiple values
   guides action.
1. (p. 242) "I arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve the
   world and a desire to enjoy the world."
