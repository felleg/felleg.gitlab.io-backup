# Review

This book is a perfect companion for [Radical Candor (read
20)](/reads/read-20-radical-candor), and I would have a hard time
picking which one I preferred between the two. I often felt like this
book put in words things I have been thinking deep down for a long time.
I love how unafraid the author is of going against the grain and pushing
ideas that he tested himself on the field. A personal highlight was the
Life Story Conversation questions (p. 204). I took the time to answer
them myself and it felt like I was having an actual session with Russ,
it was wonderful. Just like *Radical Candor*, this is an easy recommend
for anyone who has to deal with humans in the workplace.

# :star: Star quotes

1. (p. 30) The job of a manager is only two things:
    - Deliver an aligned result
    - Enable the success of the people on your teams
1. (p. 31) The manager is responsible for *everything* the team does or
   fails to do.
1. (p. 51) Overachievers abound, but they often confuse volume of work
   with impact.
1. :star: (p. 61) If you feel like you need to say "I'm in charge" or
   imply these words, you are definitely *not* in charge.
1. (p. 66) Humans don't mind hardship, in fact, they thrive on it; what
   they mind is not feeling necessary.
1. (p. 89) "Failure to plan on your part does not constitute an
   emergency on my part."
1. (p. 89) "For once, I'd like to hear someone brag about their excellent
   time management skills, rather than complain about how much they
   can't get done."
1. :star: (p. 91) If you walk around demonstrating performative
   workaholism by humblebragging/complaining about how you haven't had a
   vacation in half a year or how you always work weekends, not only are
   you probably terrible at managing your time but you are also likely
   modeling all the wrong stuff. This is leadership by poor example.
1. (p. 92) 3 > 2 > 4: "Three is greater than two is greater than four."
   This means if you have more than three priorities, you have none.
1. (p. 104) The brain can be broken down into two major parts:
    - The elephant
    - The rider
1. (p. 108) A Multiplier is a leader who gets as much as two times more
   intelligence, output, productivity, than average from their teams. A
   Diminisher, by contrast, gets half as much from their teams.
1. (p. 109) Managers who are trying to be liked create misery.
1. (p. 119) When you are talking *about* someone and not *to* someone,
   you are not helping them. You are also not helping yourself to have
   the best experience you could have at work.
1. (p. 119) If you work for a retaliator, do *not* give them feedback.
1. (p. 120) One of the most persistent and nefarious forms of bias is
   our ability to absorb the signal that suggests we're crushing it and
   our difficulty in absorbing feedback that suggests we're not.
1. (p. 120) You have an important and valid perspective, but always
   remember that this doesn't make you "right". We each have our unique
   context.
1. (p. 127) The only person who ever thinks the team meeting is totally
   rad is the person running that team meeting.
1. (p. 128) You have two ears and one mouth. Take that as a signal from
   the universe as to how much you're supposed to use each.
1. (p. 129) Let's not do anything inauthentic. The greatest reward is to
   follow up. Following up does not necessarily mean you enact whatever
   suggestion you heard!
1. (p. 130) The input you get from your teams almost always has
   *something* valuable in it that you can use.
1. (p. 139) Three words to care personally:
    - Time
    - Help
    - Success
    - (For example: "That person took the *time* to *help* me be more
      *successful*.")
1. (p. 147) We don't see things as they are. We see things as we are.
1. (p. 167) You want to help people grow into who they want to be and
   not who you need them to be or who you think they should be.
