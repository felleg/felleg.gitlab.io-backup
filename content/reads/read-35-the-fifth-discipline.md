üëçüëç - When it comes to business management, I believe this is one of the most important publications of all time. The Fifth Discipline contains just about everything you need to start thinking about in order to create your own learning organization. In particular, it taught me about "systems thinking" and "microworlds", which are concepts that I now keep top of mind when thinking about systemic issues in any dimension of life (from work to family life, and everything in between). A great book not to be missed, still as fresh today as it was in 1990.

Read [the notes I took](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g3yoB0f_aydi_ML371b2YPPWSbRsPIGG/view?usp=drive_link) from this book.
