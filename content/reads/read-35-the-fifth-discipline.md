When it comes to business management, I believe this is one of the most
important publications of all time. The Fifth Discipline contains just
about everything you need to start thinking about in order to create
your own **learning organization**. In particular, it taught me about
"systems thinking" and "microworlds", which are concepts that I now keep
top of mind when thinking about systemic issues in any dimension of life
(from work to family life, and everything in between). A great book not
to be missed, still as fresh today as it was in 1990.

I think this is my favorite my favorite book yet.

# :star: Star quotes
1. (p. 4) The ability to learn faster than your competitors may be the
   only sustainable competitive advantage.
1. (p. 10) Team learning is vital because teams, not individuals, are
   the fundamental learning unit in modern organizations. Unless teams
   can learn, the organization cannot learn.
1. (p. 22) Today, the primary threats to our survival, both of our
   organizations and of our societies, come not from sudden events but
   from slow, gradual processes.
1. (p. 75) In systems thinking, it is an axiom that every influence is
   both cause and effect. Nothing is ever influenced in just one
   direction.
1. (p. 78) At a deep level, there is no difference between blame and
   guilt, for both spring from linear perceptions.
1. (p. 94) Structures of which we are unaware holds us prisoner.
1. (p. 141) "Personal mastery" is the discipline of personal growth and
   learning. People with high levels of personal mastery are continually
   expanding their ability to create the results in life they truly
   seek. From their quest for continual learning comes the spirit of the
   learning organization.
1. (p. 185) All we ever have are assumptions, never "truths". We always
   see the world through our mental models, which are always incomplete
   and, especially in western culture, chronically nonsystemic.
1. (p. 225) Fear can produce extraordinary changes in short periods, but
   aspiration endures as a continuing source of learning and growth.
1. (p. 226) The hallmark of a great organization is "how quickly bad
   news travel upward."
1. (p. ?) Culture are the assumptions we cannot see.
1. (p. ?) Human beings are born with intrinsic motivation, and joy in
   learning.
1. (p. ?) When one human bring tells (explicitly or even only in their
   own mind) what is *real* to another human (e.g. "Don't you see what's
   really going on here?"), what they're actually doing is making a
   demand for obedience.
1. (p. ?) On one among humanity sees reality as it is and we cannot,
   because we are living systems, not recording devices.
1. (p. 241) The purpose of dialogue is to reveal the incoherence in our
   thought.
1. (p. 242) It is our thoughts and the way we hold on to them that are
   in conflict, not us.
1. (p. 245) The real power of seeing each other as colleagues comes into
   play when there are differences of view. Choosing to view
   "adversaries" as "colleagues with different views" has the greatest
   benefits.
1. (p. 247) In a discussion, decisions are made. In a dialogue, complex
   issues are explored.
1. (p. 249) :star: One of the most reliable indicators of a team that is
   continually learning is the visible conflict of ideas. In great
   teams, conflict becomes productive.
1. (p. 266) Rather than seeing the defensiveness in terms of others'
   behavior, the leverage lies in recognizing defensive routines as
   joint creations and to find our own roles in creating and sustaining
   them.
1. (p. 273) A "political environment" is one in which "who" is more
   important than "what".
1. (p. 288) In the traditional hierarchical organization, the top thinks
   and the local acts. In a learning organization, you have to merge
   thinking and acting in every individual.
1. (p. 288) The very important new role of senior managers in a locally
   controlled organization: responsibility for continually enhancing the
   organization's capacity for learning.
1. (p. 290) Most executives of traditional organizations would give up
   anything than control.
1. (p. 299) **Manager as researcher and designer** is a new role:
    - Understanding the organization as a system and understanding the
      internal and external forces driving change
    - Designs the learning process whereby managers throughout the
      organization come to understand these trends and forces
1. (p. 300) Designing the organization's learning processes is a unique
   role which cannot be delegated. It cannot be done by local managers
   because local managers are too involved running their businesses and
   because local managers generally have less breadth of perspective to
   see the major, long-term issues and forces that will shape how the
   business evolves.
1. (p. 301) :star: Learning organizations practice forgiveness because "making
   the mistake is punishment enough."
1. (p. 305) Managers may need to soften or deflect the organization's
   demands for incessant "busyness". The way each of us and each of our
   close colleagues go about managing our time will say a good deal
   about our commitment to learning.
1. (p. 310) :star: "The more I understand the real skills of leadership in a
   learning organization, the more I become convinced that these are the
   skills of effective parenting."
