# Review

- The Stoic doctrine has the unfortunate capacity to support the
  status quo.
- "I will send you the books themselves, and I will annotate them too,
  so that you need not expend much effort hunting through them for the
  profitable bits, but can get right away to what I endorse and am
  impressed with." --> Seneca was 2,000 years ahead of me!
- (p. 178) "Dying well is dying willingly," I believe that is a
  dangerous thing to say.

1. (p. 52, 85) :star: Don't be miserable before it is time. It is foolish

1. (p. 62, 73) Philosophy consists not in words but in actions. It will

1. (p. 122, 123) #speak #speech You will be right to disregard those
   who care about how much they say rather than how well, and to
   prefer, if you must, to speak haltingly. Just as a man of wisdom

1. (p. 129) :star: A good conscience welcomes a crowd; a bad one is
   racked with anxiety even in solitude.

   fear what it has not yet experienced.
1. (p. 148) "If I yield to pleasure, I must yield to pain, to toil, to
   poverty."
1. (p. 149) Pleasures embrace us just to throttle us. Make them your
