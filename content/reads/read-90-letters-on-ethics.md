# Review

On a faithful day, I was scrolling on YouTube, possible looking for
book suggestions, when I came across [this
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3JX9Xbncx0) about a user
starting a philosophy book club. I was intrigued. I became influenced.
And I ended up buying the book in question: *Letters on Ethics*, from
the Roman philosopher Seneca.

I don't know how to feel about that. I guess I now realize I am easily being
influenced because I look for answers to age old problems: Who am I?
What is my purpose? How should I live my life?

The reason I chose to read this book is because I was influenced into
it by someone who seemed to have his life in order. The stranger on
the video said that this book greatly influenced his life and pushed
him in the right direction. Thus, I couldn't resist. I had to know
what kind of wisdom philosophers from 2,000 years could teach me. I had yet to read a true philosophy book in my adult life. What is timeless wisdom? What could I learn from that?

Seneca is a philosopher from the Stoic school of thought, which is
making a comeback in 2024 thanks to popular authors like [Ryan Holiday](ryanholiday.net). I suppose that the existential crisis my
generation is going through has a lot to do with that. We are
despaired because the faith of the world seems uncertain, we have
financial stress, and we seem to have forgotten how to relate with one
another. Many of us are looking for easy answers where there are
none, and thus when someone tells us "Death awaits you, here is how to
prepare for it," we tend to listen. At least, that's the case for me.
Here is a quote from this book that in my view summarize Seneca's
philosophy:

> One who makes light of death, opens his home to
> poverty, reins in pleasure and rehearses the endurance of pain will
> experience joy that cannot be run out of.

So this is indeed a big book, written over 500 pages. It is a lengthy
read, but it is surprisingly easy to get into. The core innovation Seneca made
when writing this was brilliant: he would write letters to his friend
Lucilius, and these would become the chapters of his book. The concept
works because the letters are written as much for Lucilius as they are
for the reader of the book, i.e. me. When Seneca tells that he is
proud of Lucilius because of the progress he is making in his way of
thinking, it feels like Seneca is praising the reader directly. It is
quite touching.

In the star quotes below, I did my best to highlight what subjects are
being discussed in the book using hashtags, and here are the top 20
subjects I could identify:

1. virtue
1. fortune
1. fear
1. wealth
1. death
1. courage
1. happiness
1. wisdom
1. poverty
1. learning
1. time
1. pleasure
1. loss
1. life
1. joy
1. freedom
1. desire
1. will
1. study
1. self

As you can see, these are indeed timeless topics that apply to the
human condition, no matter your age, your sex, your ethnicity, your
social status, etc. Virtue tops this list, as it is a concept that
Seneca comes back to time and time again. According to him, virtue is
the only way to achieve true lasting happiness. I must admit that he
argues his point pretty well for someone from 2,000 years ago, better
than I ever could, anyway!

So, what did I learn from this read? I feel like I learned a lot,
actually. Seneca's attitude transcends the pages and give an example
of how to traverse hardships courageously. Quote,

> "To instill a mind with honorable ideas, nothing is more
> effective than good men's company. One can get some benefit from a
> great man even if he is silent."

Seneca is a man of his time, and thus has the annoying tendency of
refering to "humans" as "men." 

I couldn't help but laugh on the rare occasion when Seneca explicitely referred to women in
his letters to share some opinions that have not aged well at all:

> "Born to play the passive role, [some women] practice an
> utterly perverted type of obscenity (may the gods and goddesses
> destroy them!) and straddle men."
> (p. 371)

This minor flaw is something the modern
reader has to accept not to get distracted from the legitimately beautiful insights
Seneca is teaching. It really does feel like Seneca is present with the reader and talking
directly to them. I think I will keep from this read many star quotes
(see below),
or as Seneca might put them, precepts, which will help me guide my
decisions or my emotions.

While the biggest problem of the Stoic doctrine is that it has the
capacity to support the status quo, it is still a useful frame of mind
to traverse all these things over which we truly have no control.

Before I finish this review, here are some quotes I found interesting with my thoughts
attached to them:

> "I will send you the books themselves, and I will annotate them too,
>  so that you need not expend much effort hunting through them for the
>  profitable bits, but can get right away to what I endorse and am
>  impressed with."

This is something I have been doing as well with the books I read.
Seneca was 2,000 years ahead of me! I love giving annotated books to
my friends, because I feel it will help them find the golden nuggets
faster and thus profit more quickly from the book.


> (p. 178) "Dying well is dying willingly"

Seneca often says things like this, but I believe there is danger for
misinterpretation. I believe that is a dangerous thing to say in a
society where suicide is very present. It is important to keep in mind
that when Seneca says it is virtuous to die courageously, he is
implying that death is the only option. In my opinion, death is very
rarely the only option. I believe Seneca had in mind someone on their
deathbed succumbing to sickness, or an actual gladiator who has fallen
to the ground and can't get up. Indeed, here are quotes where Seneca
makes it very clear that a courageous death is built on a foundation
of willing to live:

- (p. 214) "It is wrong to steal the means of living, but very fine to
  steal the means of dying [because this could prevent a murder or a
  suicide]."
- (p. 251) "There are times when just continuous to live is a courageous action."
- (p. 468) "Nothing seems more shameful than to pray for death."

Thus, Seneca invites us to use the finiteness of our lives and the
certainty of our end to motivate us to live virtuously, so that we can
experience lasting joy from within ourselves.

> (p. 259) "Dearest Lucilius, how glad I am that we are doing this
> [exchange of letters] --
>   that we are pressing on in this direction with all our strength, even if a few people ever know; even if no one knows."

I find this quote quite touching. Seneca is expressing his joy towards
his project of exchanging letters to his friend. He knew this would
eventually become a book, and yet he had no idea if people would
read his works. He wasn't doing this for the praise. He embarked on
this writing journey because it filled him with joy: that was his
motivation! This inspires me to retrieve the same sentiment in my own
writings: writing for joy, for myself, my own benefit. We still read
Seneca's letters 2,000 years after they were written, and probably
will for as long as humanity is alive. The fact that he didn't care at
all whether this would happen surely contributed to making his work
great and timeless.

> "Precepts are only useful if we know why they are true."

This is a reminder for myself. My [Star Quotes](/star-quotes) are essentially a list
of precepts I gathered from the books I read. However, we cannot
simply take precepts at face value. We have to know *why* they are
true so we can apply them correctly. Otherwise, we might take one of
the quotes above, "Dying well is dying willingly," and make a
regrettable choice due to misunderstanding what the precept really
meant.

As Seneca says, (p. 360) "Good precepts, if they are often with you,
will be as helpful as good role models." That is what I am hoping for
myself.  By keeping a record of my favorite precepts, I hope they will
come to mind when I face hardships and guide me toward making the best
decision.

This book is filled with majestic, eternal precepts that very possibly
might have been written for the first time by Seneca himself. This
read motivated me to keep exploring ancient writings to better
appreciate where our collective wisdom comes from.

To the curious reader, I strongly recommend this book, and give it the
highest ratings. Sometimes, being influenced can be a good thing!
