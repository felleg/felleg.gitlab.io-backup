# Review

- The Stoic doctrine has the unfortunate capacity to support the
  status quo.
- "I will send you the books themselves, and I will annotate them too,
  so that you need not expend much effort hunting through them for the
  profitable bits, but can get right away to what I endorse and am
  impressed with." --> Seneca was 2,000 years ahead of me!
- (p. 178) "Dying well is dying willingly," I believe that is a
  dangerous thing to say.
- (p. 259) "Dearest Lucilius, how glad I am that we are doing this --
  that we are pressing on in this direction with all our strength, even if a few people ever know; even if no one knows."
- "Precepts are only useful if we know why they are true."
- (p. 360) Good precepts, if they are often with you, will be as
  helpful as good role models.

The notion of the "good man" e.g. p. 407, shows that this is a book of
its time. Only rarely mention women, and that's to say very outdated
things (p. 371, "born to play the passive role, they practice an
utterly perverted type of obscenity (may the gods and goddesses
destroy them!) and straddle men."). Though, to be fair, that is one of the
very rare instances where Seneca does not say something timeless. However when Seneca talks about
a "good man," what he really means is a "good human."

1. (p. 122, 123) #speak #speech You will be right to disregard those
   who care about how much they say rather than how well, and to
