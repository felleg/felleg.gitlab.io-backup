üëçüëç - This 185 pages-long book is pure meat. No fat. The work of a lifetime of thinking about systems and how they affect our world. In particular, this really connected with my Physicist brain. Systems thinking gives us the "formulas" that govern "the systems" in which we live. I will think about the concepts taught in this book for years to come. Essential read for any manager!
