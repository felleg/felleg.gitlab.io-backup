# Review

I have been working under the agile method since 2017. It's a "simple"
framework that allows teams to ship better products more quickly. I was
curious to go back to the book from which the method seems to have
originated. In 2005, _Agile Estimating & Planning_ was **the** book
about how to "do agile" in your organization.

I was already familiar with a lot of the terms coined in this book, as I
am sure most of you are too: tasks, stories, velocity, iteration,
retrospectives, etc. I didn't find much that surprised me here. However,
I was impressed at the depth in which the author discussed how to be
agile in terms of agile project management. Mike Cohn is clearly a
master at his craft.

The last chapter was a case study of a fictional team using the agile
framework to develop their new video game
([Havannah](https://senseis.xmp.net/?Havannah), an interesting
concept!). It is their first agile project. For instance, their previous
release ([Go](https://felixleger.com/posts/2022/02/les-r%C3%A8gles-du-go-en-5-minutes/) was done using the old waterfall methods. We follow them in their discussions from writing their first
stories all the way to completion. Consider this chapter the equivalent
of what [The Phoenix Project](/41) is in relation to [The DevOps
Handbook](/12). It is a fable that shows characters using all the
concepts "in real life." I didn't a chapter like this when starting the
book, so it was a nice surprise.

Unfortunately, I think the book is starting to show its age. _Agile Estimating & Planning_ will always remain a very
important book, as it is part of the foundational work that made the
Agile movement into what it is today. It is also very hands-on, practical.
You will be able to follow it. Unfortunately, some of the ways of
working are almost 20 years old at this point, and feel a little
old-school. The notion of "story" and "task" has been abused to death,
for example. The fact that I give this book a thumbs down is through no
faults of the book, as I'm sure it was a revelation to Product Owners
everywhere when it originally released in 2005. However, nowadays, I
would be more inclined to recommend books like [Project to Product](/17)
and [Shape Up](/22) that bring in fresh new ideas you are likely not to
have yet heard about. I feel like too much has been said about Agile at
this point and that it's time to use new terms to describe our work.

# :star: Star quotes:

1. (p. xxii) There are two types of uncertainty:
    - Ends uncertainty: What do we really want to build?
    - Means uncertainty: How are we going to build it?
1. (p. xxii) For most uncertainties (lack of knowledge) the only way to
   reduce the uncertainty and earn knowledge is to execute (do
   something, build something, simulate something) and then get feedback
1. (p. xxv) :star: Giving a product or project manager sage-like
   qualities to be able to foresee what others, who are experts in their
   own work, can really deliver is business suicide.
