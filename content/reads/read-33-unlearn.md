# :star: Star quotes

1. (p. 19) Clarifying your why and your what is the first step in
   the Cycle of Unlearning. It requires to accept that your own
   beliefs, mindsets or behaviors are limiting your potential and
   current performance and that you must consciously move away
   from them. This allows you to be open to new approaches and
   get unstuck.
1. (p. 21) Leaders believe they simply need to tell people to
   think differently, and they will act differently. For example,
   "What we really need is to change the mindset here." This is a
   fallacy that must, in fact, be unlearned. **The way to think
   differently is to act differently.**
1. (p. 22) Unlearning is not an event. Is it ongoing and
   continuous, a habit and deliberate practice in itself.
1. (p. 27) Move from a "know it all" to an "unlearn it all".
1. (p. 35) Nothing pleases people more than to go on thinking
   what they have always thought, and at the same time imagine
   that they are thinking something new and daring. It combines
   the advantage of security with the delight of adventure.
1. (p. 46) The problem with transformation is never a lack of
   ideas; it's a lack of a change in behavior.
1. (p. 49) "Half of the leaders I have met don't need to learn
   what to do. They need to learn what to stop."
1. (p. 51) The first step in the Cycle of Unlearning is
   identifying what we want to work on to unlearn, and then
   deliberately practicing to relearn it.
1. (p. 55) Example of an unlearning statement:
    - I will unlearn *decision making* in *3 months*.
    - I know I have unlearned when:
        - 100% of my decisions are safe to fail
        - 100% of my direction is what is to be achieved with
          context of why it matters
        - 0% of my direction is how to achieve it, the
          accountable individuals will decide
        - 0% of teams I lead demonstrate learned helplessness for
          their decision-making responsibilities.
1. (p. 63) The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those
   who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn
   and relearn.
1. (p. 84) We love being busy. In fact, we celebrate and subtly
   enjoy telling our colleagues, collaborators, and competitors
   how busy we are. The question we don't consider is: What is
   the result of all this busyness? All this motion is mistaken
   for progress, but it's not, like hamsters in their wheels.
1. (p. 95) Great leaders get better answers because they ask
   better questions. They ask them in ways that increases the
   rate at which they unlearn, relearn and break through.
1. (p. 102) One person can't know all that each member of his or
   her team knows.
1. (p. 103) Knowledge workers can't (and shouldn't) be supervised
   or managed in the same way that workers in factories used to
   be. To make the right decision the knowledge worker must know
   what performance and results are needed. He or she cannot be
   supervised. They must direct, manage and motivate themself,
   and they will not do that unless they can see how their
   knowledge and work contribute to the whole business.
1. (p. 103) While it may seem counterintuitive, the breakthrough
   that every manager needs to discover and practice is that you
   become a better and more effective leader when you let go,
   relinquish control, and empower the people you lead to take
   control and make their own decisions.
1. (p. 105) A favorable situation will never be exploited if
   commanders wait for orders. The highest commander and the
   youngest soldier must be conscious of the fact that omission
   and inactivity are worse than resorting to the wrong
   expedient.
1. (p. 116) The management innovation to unlearn is to stop
   making decisions and let other people make decisions.
   First-line employees can be more than cogs in a soulless
   manufacturing machine; they can be problem solvers, innovators
   and change agents.
1. (p. 122) The reason many companies are slow and languid is
   because employees aren't allowed to make decisions.
1. (p. 127) As a leader, respond to negative outcomes and
   critical feedback as an opportunity to improve the system
   (instead of as an excuse to blame the individual).
1. (p. 135) "Thanks for your feedback. We are going to fix that.
   That's not the way we want our products and services to be
   delivered, and that's not the way we want out customers to be
   treated. You're helping us build a better product, so thank
   you again."
1. (p. 147) Waiting for failure events to prompt action is the
   definition of failure to unlearn and innovate your
   organization's system of learning.
1. (p. 151) :star: Remind leaders that scaling yourself does not work;
   scaling your lessons learned does.
1. (p. 151) Having a safe space for team members to share
   mistakes and be vulnerable in front of one another is the
   number-one indicator of high-performance teams.
1. (p. 167) :star: You get what you reward for.
1. (p. 204) :star: To attain knowledge, add things every day. To attain
   wisdom, remove things every day.
1. (p. 205) Unlearning is *not* forgetting, removing or
   discarding knowledge or experience; it's the conscious act of
   letting go of outdated information and actively engaging in
   taking in new information to inform effective decision making
   and action.
