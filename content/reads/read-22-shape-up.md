# Review

Really clever framework that has the potential to replace Agile and
Scrum. I hope I'll get to try it out someday. Everything just clicks!

free](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) (Thanks Beno√Æt Dicaire for this
recommendation!)

# :star: Star quotes

1. (p. 14)The idea of Shape Up is to focus less on estimates and more on our
   **appetite**.
    - :x: "How much time will it take?"
    - :white_check_mark: "How much time do we want to **spend**?"
    - :white_check_mark: "How much is this idea worth?"
1. (p. 15) **Shaping**: Narrowing down the problem and designing the
   outline of a solution that fits within the constraints of our
   appetite
1. (p. 25) Shaped work indicates what *not* to do, where to stop. It
   calls out any specific cases not supported. It creates boundaries
   that act like guard rails.

1. (p. 74) It's easy to overvalue ideas. The truth is, ideas are cheap.
   They come up all the time and accumulate into big piles.

   solving.
