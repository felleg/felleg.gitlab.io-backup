# Review

Really clever framework that has the potential to replace Agile and
Scrum. I hope I'll get to try it out someday. Everything just clicks!
[This book is also available online for
free](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) (Thanks Benoit for this
recommendation!)

1. (p. 90) The solution doesn't matter if the problem isn't worth
   solving.
