# Review

Really clever framework that has the potential to replace Agile and
Scrum. It turns development into a *game*. I hope I'll get to try it out someday. Everything just clicks!

# :star: Star quotes

1. (p. 14)The idea of Shape Up is to focus less on estimates and more on our
   **appetite**.
    - :x: "How much time will it take?"
    - :white_check_mark: "How much time do we want to **spend**?"
    - :white_check_mark: "How much is this idea worth?"
1. (p. 15) **Shaping**: Narrowing down the problem and designing the
   outline of a solution that fits within the constraints of our
   appetite
1. (p. 25) Shaped work indicates what *not* to do, where to stop. It
   calls out any specific cases not supported. It creates boundaries
   that act like guard rails.
1. (p. 26) To be a shaper, you don't need to be a programmer, but you need to
be technically literate. You should be able to judge:
    - what's possible
    - what's easy
    - what's hard
1. (p. 26) Shaping is a closed-door, creative process, a kind of
private, rough early work. The work on the shaping track is kept
private and not shared with the wider team until the commitment has
been made to bet on it.
1. (p. 26) During the six weeks cycle, teams are building work that's
been previously shaped, while shapers are working on what the teams
might potentially build in a future cycle.
1. (p. 27) **Steps to shaping**:
    1. Set boundaries (what is our appetite?).
    1. Create an idea that solves the problem within the appetite, but
    without all the fine details worked out.
    1. Address risks and rabbit holes.
    1. Write the pitch that will be reviewed at the betting table.
1. (p. 29)
    - **Estimates** start be a design and end with a number.
    - **Appetites** start with a number and end with a design. The
      appetite acts as a creative constraint on the design process.
1. (p. 30) There is no absolute definition of "the best" solution. The
best is relative to your constraints.
1. (p. 32) **Finding the real problem to solve**: At what point specifically does someone's current workflow
break down without this thing they're asking for?
    - "Instead of asking her why she wants a calendar and what it
should look like, we asked her *when* she wanted a calendar. What was
she doing when the thought occurred to ask for it?"
1. (p. 37) When **breadboarding**, what matters are the components and
their connections (not pictures) to judge if the sequence of actions solves the use
case:
    - {{< figure src="https://basecamp.com/assets/books/shapeup/1.3/invoice_breadboard_6-728e11c77b57f3c4ee56c00187a7c760562090f3733a4aec43cc05a2f95bb003.png" position="center" caption="" >}}
1. (p. 41) Use **fat marker sketches** when the 2D arrangement of elements
is the fundamental problem. Make such broad strokes that adding detail
is difficult/impossible.
    - Large Sharpies on a sheet of paper
    - iPad drawing with the largest diameter pen size
    - {{< figure src="https://basecamp.com/assets/books/shapeup/1.3/calendar_dot_grid-7d1e375f646a32517d5d8d7ad444e45a09a54ac8f27e0abb059d71bd68650e55.png" position="center" caption="" scale="70%">}}
1. (p. 46) The output of breadboarding and fat marker sketches are not
specs. They are the boundaries and rules of a game.
1. (p. 47) At the shaping stage, we could walk away from the project.
We haven't bet on it.
1. (p. 55) :star: When discussing with technical experts, instead of asking,
"Is it possible to do X?" ask "Is X possible in 6 weeks?" and
emphasize you're looking for risks that could blow up the project.
1. (p. 55) Rather than writing up a document or creating a slideshow,
invite experts to a whiteboard and redraw the elements s you worked
them out earlier, building up the concept from the beginning.
1. (p. 58-60, 64) **Five ingredients to always include in a pitch**:
    - The **problem**: Why the status quo doesn't work.
      - This gives you something to test against.
    - An **appetite**: How much time we want to spend and how much that
      constrains the solution.
        - There's always a better solution.
    - A solution: The core elements we came up with presented in a
      form that's easy to immediately understand.
        - Fat marker sketches can be very effective if labeled cleanly.
    - **Rabbit holes**
    - **No-gos**: Anything specifically excluded from the concept to
      fit the appetite.
1. (p. 67) For presenting a pitch, use asynchronous communication by
default and escalate to real-time only when necessary. Pitches could
be tracked as Jira tickets or messages on Slack.
1. (p. People comment on the pitches asynchronously. Not to say yes or
no (that happens at the betting table) but to poke holes or contribute
missing information.
1. (p. 72) Pitches don't go in a backlog! Before each six weeks cycle,
the betting table looks at pitches from the last six weeks, including
pitches that somebody purposefully revived and lobbied for again. This
removes grooming.
1. (p. 73) If we don't bet on a pitch, we let it go. There's nothing
we need to track or hold on to.
1. (p. 76) After each six week cycle, we schedule two weeks for
cool-down. This is a period with no scheduled work where we can
breathe, meet as needed, and consider what to do next.
    - Programmers and
designers use this time to fix bugs, explore new ideas, try out new
technical possibilities.
1. (p. 77) **The betting table** is a meeting held during cool-down
where stakeholders decide what to do in the next cycle.
1. (p. 77) At Basecamp, the betting table consists of:
    - CEO (they are the last word on the product)
    - CTO
    - A senior programmer
    - A product strategist
      - Buy-in from the very top makes cycles turn properly.
1. (p. 78) The betting table rarely lasts longer than an hour or two.
It requires everyone to have had a chance to study the pitches on
their own time beforehand.
1. (p. 78) The betting table gives the C-suite a "hands on the wheel"
feeling.
1. (p. 78) We talk about "betting" instead of planning because it sets
different expectations.
1. (p. 79) When you make a bet, you honor it. Don't allow the team to
be interrupted or pulled away to do other things.
1. (p. 82) The vast majority of bugs can wait six weeks or longer and
many don't even need to be fixed.
1. (p. 82) If a bug is too big to fix during a cool-down, it can
compete for resources at the betting table.
1. (p. 82) Schedule a **bug smash** once a year, usually around
holidays, where a whole cycle is dedicated to fixing bugs.
    - The holidays are a good time because it's hard to get a normal
      project done when people aren't around.
1. (p. 90) **Questions to ask at the betting table**:
    - Does the problem matter?
    - Is the appetite right?
    - Is the solution attractive?
      - The betting table shouldn't be used for doing the design
    - Is this the right time?
    - Are the right people available?
1. (p. 93) After the bets are made, someone from the betting table
will write a message that tells everyone *which projects* we're
betting on for the next cycle and who will be working on them.
1. (p. 96) There is no designated "task master" or "architect" who
splits the project into pieces. Trust the team to take on the entire
project and work within the boundaries of the pitch.
1. (p. 98) All testing and QA needs to happen within the cycle.
1. (p. 98) We don't expect these things to happen within the cycle, we
can do them during a cool-down:
    - help documentation
    - marketing updates
    - announcements to customers
1. (p. 99) When the cycle begins, arrange a kick-off call to walk
through the shaped work. This gives the team a chance to ask any
important questions that aren't clear from the write-up.
1. (p. 100) In the first few days of the cycle, expect radio silence.
Everyone is busy learning the existing system and getting oriented.
Only if the radio silence doesn't start to break after three days,
then step in to see what's going on.
1. (p. 101)
    - **Imagined tasks** are tasks we *think* we need to do at the
      start of a project
    - **Discovered tasks** are tasks we *discover* we need to do in
      the course of doing real work. These make the true bulk of the
      project and sometimes present the hardest challenges.
1. (p. 102) The way to really figure out what needs to be done is to
start doing real work.
1. (p. 103) Teams should aim to make something tangible and demoable
early (in the first week or so)
1. (p. 110) First make it work, then make it beautiful.
1. (p. 111) When you are early in the cycle, don't slow down to
implement something that won't teach you anything about the problem
you're trying to solve (e.g. colors, handling data securely, etc.)
1. (p. 116) The scopes reflect the meaningful parts of the problem
that can be completed independently and in a short period of time (few
days or less). In practice, we define and track scopes as to-do lists. {{< figure src="https://basecamp.com/assets/books/shapeup/3.3/drafts_6-a511456472dd9b348e6fc314781a8e6c91e7ae942eed0779036539bf27bbb530.png" position="center" caption="" >}}
    - More tasks will be discovered as work continues.
1. (p. 122) Scoping isn't planning. You need to walk the territory
before you can draw the map, like in Starcraft.
1. (p. 123) The scopes act like buckets that you can easily lob new
tasks into.
1. (p. 123) **Three signs that indicate the scopes should be
redrawn:**
    - It's hard to say how "done" a scope is. This happens when the
      tasks inside the scope are unrelated.
    - The scope name isn't unique to the project, like "front-end" or
      "bugs". These are grab bags, or junk drawers.
    - It's too big to finish soon. Better break it up into pieces that
      can be solved in less time, so there are victories along the way
      and boundaries between the problems to solve.
1. (p. 125) **Icebergs** are when there is significantly more backend
work than frontend work, or vice versa. For icebergs, it can help to
factor out the UI as a separate scope of work.
    - **Always** question icebergs before accepting them as a fact.
1. (p. 126) Do **scope hammering** by prefixing your nice-to-haves
with "~" in the task list.
1. (p. 127) Managers can't rely on the to-do list status because it
will grow as the team makes progress.
1. (p. 133) The hill chart shows how the work on each scope *feels* at different
stages for each scope. For managers, it shows how the work is
*moving*. It removes the need to interrupt the team with status update
questions. {{< figure src="https://basecamp.com/assets/books/shapeup/3.4/hill_concept-a0a77c0ebb209b61899b8b4cdb1a315f2807e3fdc2e1d2373e2f19060725f042.png" position="center"
caption="" >}}
1. (p. 136) When a point on a hill chart doesn't move, it is
effectively a raised hand: "Something might be wrong here. What can we
solve to get over that hill?"
1. (p. 139) Backsliding on the hill chart often means somebody did the
uphill work with their head instead of their hands.
1. (p. 142) Shipping on time means shipping something imperfect.
    - "Okay, this isn't perfect, but it definitely works and customers
      will feel like this is a big improvement for them."
1. (p. 145) Cutting scope isn't lowering quality. Making choices makes
the product better. It *differentiates* the product.
1. (p. 146) Nice-to-haves ("~") can linger on a scope after it's
considered done. The scope isn't considered done until must-have tasks
are finished.
1. (p. 148) QA generates "discovered tasks" that are all nice-to-haves
("~") by default.
1. (p. 148) **When to extend a project** instead of letting the
circuit breaker do its thing:
    - The outstanding tasks are true must-haves
    - The outstanding work must be downhill
      - Any uphill work at the end of the cycle shows an oversight in
        the shaping, or a hole in the concept.
1. (p. 151) The raw ideas that just came in from customer feedback
aren't actionable yet. They too need to be shaped.
1. (p. 169) **How to begin doing Shape Up: A six-week experiment**:
    1. Shape one significant project that can be comfortably finished
    within 6 weeks. Be conservative on your first run.
    1. Carve out one designer and two programmers' time for the entire
    6 weeks. Guarantee that *nobody* will interrupt them for the
    length of the experiment.
    1. Replace the real betting table with just the plan for the team
    to do the work you shaped for the experiment.
    1. Kick off by presenting your shaped work to the team, with all
    the ingredients of a pitch. Set the expectation that they will
    discover and track their own tasks.
    1. Dedicate a physical space or chat room to the cross-functional
    team so they can work closely together.
    1. Encourage them to Get One Piece Done by wiring UI and code
    together early in the project.
