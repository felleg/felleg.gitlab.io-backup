# Review

Ray Dalio, one of the richest and most successful individuals on this
planet, heads Bridgewater, the world‚Äôs largest hedge fund, consistently
touted as one of the most successful globally. Remarkably, his entire
success is attributed to a set of principles he developed and refined
over time, guiding his relationships and decision-making. In his book
"Principles," he shares the recipe for his success.

How‚Äôs that for a sales pitch?

"Principles" is a substantial book. I must admit that towards the end, I
was feeling fatigued. It's understandable, though; the book spans
roughly 550 pages, equivalent to trying to drink from a fire hose. After
the approximately 100-page autobiographical section, the author
succinctly lays out his life and work principles. The text serves merely
to put them in context. His writing is rapid, akin to a machine gun:
nugget after nugget after nugget, a barrage of wisdom accumulated over
decades of leading the world‚Äôs largest hedge fund. I doubt this book was
meant to be read at the pace I was reading it, just like all my book
reviews aren‚Äôt meant to be read in one sitting. This book is meant to be
slowly digested or used as a reference. There is so much to talk about
in here.

As you can see below, I managed to accumulate 52 star quotes from this
read, which is certainly above average for me. A lot of it is common
sense, which, as I‚Äôm beginning to learn, is a misleading way of saying
‚Äúexperience.‚Äù Ray Dalio's teachings extend in all directions, simply
because his own experience is so vast.

From reading Dalio‚Äôs biography, it seems obvious to me that he never
expected to become as successful as he was. What he consciously did was
invest in the idea of principled decision-making, also known as the idea
meritocracy, and simply got curious about how far he could push it. The
rest took care of itself. To that effect, this book is the logical
conclusion of a lifetime of synthesizing one‚Äôs train of thought for
others to grasp onto. A wannabe author like myself can‚Äôt help thinking,
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a long way from writing a book as good as Ray Dalio‚Äôs
'Principles.'‚Äù While this is as bleak and envious a thought a would-be
author can have, the sole existence of this book also gives me hope.
Being diligent and curious is the foundation of the work that allowed
Dalio to write this book. In that sense, I very humbly feel that by
writing book reviews such as this one, I‚Äôm proving to myself that I also
have these traits. My ego is still too big for my own head, but I feel
that time and life are both on my side on that front.

Above all else, this book made me contemplate the core idea of having
principles. While reading a thought leader‚Äôs list of principles is
certainly enlightening, it did make me ponder my own principles. What
measuring sticks do I use when making decisions to determine if I shall
go left or go right? If I were to capture such principles in written
form every time I make a decision, what would the end result look like?
How much better can a relationship be when both parties know they share
the same principles?

I‚Äôm looking forward to finding out.

# :star: Star quotes

1. (p. xiv) Shift from having a perspective of "I know I'm right" to
   having one of "How do I know I'm right?"
1. (p. 38) Go slowly when faced with the choice between two things that
   you need that are seemingly at odds. That way you can figure out how
   to have as much of both as possible. There is almost always a good
   path that you just haven't discovered yet, so look for it until you
   find it rather than settle for the choice that is then apparent to
   you.
1. (p. 71) While one gets better at things over time, it doesn't become
   any easier if one is also progressing to higher levels -- the
   Olympic athlete finds his sport to be every bit as challenging as the
   novice does.
1. (p. 79) The greatest success you can have as the person in charge is
   to orchestrate others to do things well without you. A step below
   that is doing things well yourself, and worst of all is doing things
   poorly yourself.
1. (p. 91) Life consists of three phases:
   1. First, we are dependent on others and we learn
   2. Then, others depend on us and we work
   3. Finally, others no longer depend on us and we no longer have to work. We
       are free to savor life.
1. (p. 123) Having the basics -- a good bed to sleep in, good
   relationships, good food, good sex -- is most important and those
   things don't get much better when you have a lot of money or much
   worse when you have less. And the people one meets at the top aren't
   necessarily more special than one meets at the bottom or in between.
1. (p. 145) Perfection doesn't exist; it is a goal that fuels a
   never-ending process of adaptation. If nature, or anything, were
   perfect it wouldn't be evolving.
1. (p. 152) If you can develop a reflexive reaction to psychic pain that
   causes you to reflect on it rather than avoid it, it will lead to
   your rapid learning/evolving.
1. (p. 172) Don't confuse goals with desires. A proper *goal* is something
   that you really need to achieve. *Desires* are things that you want
   that can prevent you from reaching your goals. Typically, desires are
   first-order consequences.
1. (p. 174) Acknowledging your mistakes is not the same as surrendering
   to them. It's the first step toward overcoming them.
1. (p. 176) **Proximate causes** are typically the actions (or lack of
   actions) that lead to problems, so they are described with verbs ("I
   *missed* the train because I didn't *check* the schedule"). **Root
   causes** run much deeper and they are typically described with
   adjectives ("I didn't check the train schedule because I am
   *forgetful*").
1. (p. 189) You can't put out (convey thinking and be productive)
   without taking in (learn).
1. (p. 192) Holding wrong opinions in one's head and making bad
   decisions based on them instead of having thoughtful disagreements is
   one of the greatest tragedies of mankind.
1. (p. 197) If your statement starts with "I could be wrong" or "I'm not
   believable", you should probably follow it with a question and not an
   assertion.
1. (p. 199) Consult others when you find yourself about to make a
   decision in an area that is your blind spot, where in the past you've
   constantly made bad decisions.
1. (p. 199) If a number if different believable people say you are doing
   something wrong and you are the only one who doesn't see it that way,
   assume that you are probably biased.
1. (p. 228) The five types of the Team Dimensions Profile:
   - **Creators** generate new ideas and original concepts
   - **Advancers** communicate these new ideas and carry them forward.
     They relish feelings and relationships and manage the human factors.
     They are excellent at generating enthusiasm for work.
   - **Refiners** challenge ideas. They analyze projects for flaws, then
     refine them with a focus on objectivity and analysis. They love
     facts and theories and working with a systematic approach.
   - **Executors** can also be thought of as Implementers. They ensure
     that important activities are carried out and goals accomplished;
     they are focused on details and the bottom line.
   - **Flexors** are a combination of all four types. They can adapt
     their styles to fit certain needs and are able to look at a problem
     from a variety of perspectives.
1. (p. 254) All of your "must-dos" must be above the bar before you do
   your "like-to-dos".
1. (p. 255) Any damn fool can make it complex. It takes a genius to make
   it simple.
1. (p. 299) An organization is a machine consisting of two major parts:
   culture and people. The people who make up an organization determine
   the kind of culture it has, and the culture of the organization
   determines the kinds of people who fit in.
1. (p. 321) To have an idea meritocracy,
   - Put your honest thoughts on the table
   - Have a thoughtful disagreement
   - Abide by agreed-upon ways of getting past disagreements
1. (p. 327) Never say anything about someone that you wouldn't say to
   them directly. There is never a good reason to bad-mouth people
   behind their backs.
1. (p. 328) Managers should not talk about people who work for them if
   they are not in the room.
1. (p. 328) In some companies, employees hide their employer's mistakes,
   and employers do the same in return. This is unhealthy and stands in
   the way of improvement.
1. (p. 329) Create an environment in which everyone has the right to
   understand what makes sense and no one has the right to hold a
   critical opinion without speaking up.
1. (p. 342) To have a good relationship, you must be clear with each
   other about what the quid pro quo is:
   - What is generous
   - What is fair
   - What is just plain taking advantage
1. (p. 348) Create a culture in which it is okay to make mistakes and
   unacceptable not to learn from them.
1. (p. 350) It is important to know the difference between 1) capable
   people who made mistakes and are self-reflective and open to learning
   from them and 2) incapable people, or capable people who aren't able
   to embrace their mistakes and learn from them.
1. (p. 351) If you don't have a willingness to fail, you're going to
   have to be very careful not to invent.
1. (p. 351) People who are just succeeding must not be pushing their
   limits.
1. (p. 354) Pain + Reflection = Progress.
1. (p. 364) "I often hear people complaining about the style or tone of
   a criticism in order to deflect from its substance. If you think
   someone's style is an issue, box it as a separate issue to get in
   sync on."
1. (p. 386) If you don't think the principles provide the right way to
   resolve a problem or disagreement, you need to fight to change the
   principles, not just do what you want to do.
1. (p. 399) People often make the mistake of focusing on what should be
   done while neglecting the more important question of who should be
   given the responsibility for determining what should be done
1. (p. 414) The person with good character and poor abilities, while
   likeable, won't get the job done and is painfully difficult to fire
   because doing so feels like shooting the loyal dog you can't afford
   to keep anymore -- but they must go.
1. (p. 417) There's not enough money in the world to get you to part
   with a valued relationship.
1. (p. 422) Changing someone's values is something you should never
   count on.

   might seem kind but isn't accurate is harmful to the person.
1. (p. 428) The most powerful transformations come from experiencing the
   pain from mistakes that a person never wants to have again -- aka
   "hitting bottom".
1. (p. 453) When a problem occurs, conduct the discussion at two levels:

   - The case-at-hand level (*what* to do about it)
1. (p. 455) Managing people who report to you should feel like skiing
   together.
1. (p. 461) All your little problems are small pieces of trash you're
   stepping over to get to the other side of a room.

   followers.
1. (p. 465) The kind of leader who looks and acts like a skilled ninja
   will beat the kind of leader who looks and acts like a muscular
   action hero every time.
1. (p. 466) The greatest influence you can have over intelligent people
   -- and the greatest influence they will have on you -- comes from
   constantly getting in sync about what is true and what is best so
   that you all want the same things.
1. (p. 473) Problems are like coal thrown into a locomotive engine
   because burning them up -- inventing and implementing solutions for
   them -- propels us forward.
1. (p. 475) Acknowledging a weakness isn't the same thing as accepting
   it. It's a necessary first step toward overcoming it.
1. (p. 478) Think of yourself as a chef and taste the soup before it

   imperfect and make mistakes.

   your job will be done if you are no longer around.
