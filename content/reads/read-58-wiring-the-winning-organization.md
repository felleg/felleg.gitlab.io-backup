# Review

For a number of years, I have grown dissatisfied with the
term "DevOps". Don't get me wrong; I am still incredibly thankful for
the DevOps community that made me aware of a different way to see work
and collaboration. In the past year, my understanding of DevOps shifted
from a pipeline-centric approach to a learning-centric one. I fantasized
about how we could use the DevOps way of thinking to streamline
processes between teams that don't have the names "Dev" and "Ops", teams
that might not even write code. I was daydreaming about using DevOps to
solve problems happening between Marketing and HR teams.

However, not everyone agreed with me. I was recently told, "What you are
talking about has value, but it is not DevOps. Please stop using the
DevOps name in conjunction with your ideas, because you are hurting the
movement and our efforts." Ouch.

I believe the term "DevOps" has outstayed its welcome. I say this
because I started noticing that depending on who you ask what the DevOps
movement is working towards, you'll get a different answer. This is a
problem when you say your company "does DevOps". What does that even
mean? The problem here is an eternal one: naming things correctly is simply
really, really hard.

I think authors Gene Kim and Steven J. Spear tackled this challenge head-on
when writing this book. When Kim made DevOps mainstream
with [The Phoenix Project](/books/book-41-1-the-phoenix-project/) in
2013, he was actually showing us the tip of an immense iceberg. What he called
DevOps at the time was actually a subset of a much broader perspective
that could be applied to any type of work and problem-solving. It was time to
give this movement a new name, something more general that could be used
on a much bigger scale than only between Dev and Ops teams.

In their new philosophy gravitating around "Social Circuitry", the
authors give us new words to break free from the shackles of
"Dev" and "Ops". Here, we talk about the "winning zone",
the "danger zone", coherence, coupling, the three layers of work, and the various "-ion"
methods that help Layer 3 workers to wire their organizations with
intent.

As a student of Physics, I am seduced by this new way of thinking. It is as if
Kim and Spear managed to write the unifying equations that tie all the
different work improvement movements of the past in one simple, coherent
toolbox. See in the figure below how they were able to generalize and
simplify a multitude existing concepts through the lens of
slowification, simplification and amplification:

{{< figure src="/img/wiring-practices.png" position="center" caption="How different practices slowify, simplify, or amplify" >}}

A person who was previously operating from a DevOps perspective
now operates from "Layer 3", the social circuitry, and has at their
disposal the following tools:

- **Slowification**  makes solving problems easier to do (more time to think)
- **Simplification** makes the problems themselves easier to solve (less
  complex)
  - **Modularization** partitions a large, complex system into coherent
    modules
  - **Incrementalization**  breaks a few, complex experiments in many
    smaller, faster experiments
  - **Linearization** sequences tasks to flow successively
    - **Standardization** of tasks and exchanges at the delivery boundaries
    - **Stabilization** of problems to contain them and prevent spreading
    - **Self-synchronization** of the system without top-down monitoring
- **Amplification** makes it obvious that there are problems that demand
  attention and whether or not they've been addressed

Overall, this is a brand new, deeply profound insight from two of the
most acclaimed
management gurus of our time. I am very excited to put their new
thoughts to
practice. Wiring an organization to win is probably the most
important challenge in technology today, but thankfully we finally have
a clear and coherent set of tools that allow us to get there.

P.S. If I could make one suggestion to the authors, a simple change in
the  visual presentation of the different layers of work. It would be to
picture Layer 1 work at the top and Layer 3 work at the bottom. I don't
like the visual presentation of having a "Layer 3 worker" live on top of
a "Layer 1 worker". Layer 3 supports Layer 1 & 2, and Layer 2 supports Layer 1.
And Layer 1 are heroes.

# :star: Star quotes

1. (p. 20) In all but the smallest endeavors, a leader's primary
   contribution is *not* doing the work required to achieve the goal.
   Instead, they are responsible for everything required to enable that
   work to be done easily and well. This is achieved through the social
   circuitry by which people's collaborative efforts are easily
   coordinated and integrated.
1. (p. 41) __The Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem__: A receiver (sensor)
   must sample at least twice the rate of the sender (the thing being
   monitored and controller) to accurately measure and control a system.
   Thus, if reports are generated and reviewed once a week, they can be
   used to control (manage) only situations that change no faster or
   more frequently than every 2 weeks.
1. (p. 97) As a leader, are you humble and open-minded enough to expose
   your *best* ideas to aggressive testing? When those tests find flaws,
   will you be receptive enough to recognize that your best ideas have
   been refuted? Once those ideas are refuted, will you solicit the
   contributions of others to generate new ideas that can be tested?
1. (p. 132) Multitasking is a source of cognitive load. It [invariably]
   degrades performance.
1. (p. 251) Communication is not about speaking what we think. It's
   about ensuring others hear what we mean.
1. (p. 255) The best predictors of performance in tech environments:
   - to what extent important info can be shared
   - how messengers of bad news are trained to tell bad news
   - how responsibilities are shared across functional specialities
   - how bridging between teams is rewarded
   - how failure causes genuine inquiry
