# Review

This book made me think a lot. I enjoyed how it took an almost
anatomical approach to the concept of "the idea". I think that the star
quotes below will do a better than job me at summarizing what is
interesting about this book. It's a very "meta" book, and it's
challenging to discuss the idea of "how ideas work", but the author does
a very good job there. In particular, you'll hear of how Darwin came to his famous
Theory of Evolution, and the author will take you through all the twists
and turns in Darwin's method of working to really show you where good
ideas come from. In my view, this book demolishes the myth of the "genius
working in a lab", and instead makes the bold statement that the ground
zero of innovation is the conference table. Serendipity, the adjacent possible, the slow hunch,
commonplacing, coffeehouses... these are all the practices that could lead you to your
next big idea.

Luck favors the connected mind. Good luck!

# :star: Star quotes

1. (p. 29) Our ideas are works of bricolage, built out of and
   constrained by the spare parts, detritus and skills that surround
   them.
1. (p. 31) The strange and beautiful truth about the adjacent possible
   is that its boundaries grow as you explore those boundaries. Think of
   it as a house that magically expands with each door you open. Keep
   opening new doors and eventually you'll have built a palace.
1. (p. 45) A good idea is a network. A new idea is a network of cells
   exploring the adjacent possible of connections that they can make in
   your mind.
1. (p. 58) It's not that the network itself is smart; it's that the
   individuals get smarter because they're connected to the network.
1. (p. 61) The ground zero of innovation is not the microscope. It is
   the conference table.
1. (p. 65) Information spillover is a feature, not a flaw.
1. (p. 76) Hunches that don't connect are doomed to stay hunches.
1. (p. 78) Sustaining the slow hunch is less a matter of perspiration
   than of *cultivation*. You give the hunch enough nourishment to keep
   it growing, and plant it in fertile soil, where its roots can make
   new connections. And then you give it time to bloom.
1. (p. 78) The slow hunch is the rule, not the exception.
1. (p. 84) "Commonplacing" involves transcribing interesting or
   inspirational passages from one's reading, assembling a personalized
   encyclopedia of quotations. Maintaining a commonplace book enables
   one to lay up a fund of knowledge from which we may at all times
   select what is useful at in the various pursuits of life.
1. (p. 87) You need a system for capturing hunches, but not necessarily
   categorizing them, because categories can build barriers between
   disparate ideas, restrict them to their own conceptual islands.
1. (p. 101) Dreams are not somehow unveiling a repressed truth. Instead,
   it is our brain exploring, trying to find new truths by experimenting
   with novel combinations of neurons.
1. (p. 134) The history of being spectacularly right has a shadow
   history lurking behind it: a much longer history of being
   spectacularly wrong, again and again. And not just wrong, but messy.
1. (p. 136) Generative mistakes are generative precisely because they
   connect to slow hunches in the minds of their creators.
1. (p. 137) Being right keeps you in place. Being wrong forces you to
   explore.
1. (p. 138) The error is needed to set off the truth, much as a dark
   background is required for exhibiting the brightness of a picture.
1. (p. 142) It's not enough to say "to err is human". Error is what made
   humans possible in the first place.
1. (p. 174) Chance favors the connected mind.
1. (p. 191) Genres are the platforms and paradigms of the creative
   world. They fade into view, through a complicated set of shared
   signals passed between artists, each contributing different elements
   to the mix.
1. (p. 199) Innovation thrives in discarded spaces.
1. (p. 200) Old ideas can sometimes use new buildings. New ideas must
   use old buildings.
1. (p. 209) When you don't have to ask for permission, innovation
   thrives.
1. (p. 235) Fourth-quadrant innovation (non-market network) creates a
   new open platform that commercial entities can them build upon,
   either by repackaging and refining the original breakthrough, or by
   developing emergent innovations on top of the underlying platform.
1. (p. 243) The more government think of itself as an open platform
   instead of a centralized bureaucracy, the better it will be for all
   of us, citizens and activists and entrepreneurs alike.
1. (p. 246) Go for a walk; cultivate hunches; write everything down, but
   keep your folders messy; embrace serendipity; make generative
   mistakes; take on multiple hobbies; frequent coffeehouses and other
   liquid networks; follow the links; let others build on your ideas;
   borrow, recycle, reinvent; build a tangled bank.
