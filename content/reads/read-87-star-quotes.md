# Review

# [Link to free full text](/star-quotes/)

This is a pretty self-explanatory concept. This "book" is a compilation
of all the star quotes you can find on my website
(https://felixleger.com/books). I don't expect much people to read
this in its entirety: it might feel like trying to drink from a
fire hose. Attempt at your own peril! :smile: It's a convenient way
for me to quickly `Ctrl-F` information. Feel free to try it out too,
you might find something useful!

The full text of the book is
actually created using GitLab's CI/CD and a little bash script of my
own creation:

{{< figure src="/img/star-quotes-script.png" position="center" caption="The script powering the Star Quotes!" >}}

Ah, the power of the command line!
