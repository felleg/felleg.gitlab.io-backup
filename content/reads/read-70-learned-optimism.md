# :star: Star quotes:

1. (p. 4) The defining characteristic of pessimists is that they tend to
   believe bad events will last a long time, will undermine everything
   they do, and are their own fault..
1. (p. 7) Our thoughts are not merely reactions to events; they change
   what ensues.
1. (p. 7) Pessimistic prophecies are self-fulfilling.
1. (p. 8) Habits of thinking need not be forever. One of the most
   significant findings in psychology in the last 20 years is that
   individuals can change the way they think.
1. (p. 15) :star: See events as successes or failures of personal control.
1. (p. 72) Love comes rarely in life, and if you waste your life mooning
   over its all too ordinary absence, you are bringing on your own
   depression. You are living under a tyranny of *shoulds*. Stop
   'should-ing' on yourself!
1. (p. 74) Emotion comes directly from what we think:
    - Think "I am in danger" and you feel anxiety.
    - Think "I am being trespassed against" and you feel danger.
    - Think "Loss" and you feel sadness.
1. (p. 75) How you think about your problems, including depression
   itself, will either relieve depression or aggravate it.
1. (p. 75) If your explanatory style is optimistic, your depression will
   be halted.
1. (p. 77) There is one particularly self-defeating way to think: making
   personal, permanent and pervasive explanations for bad events. People
   who have this most pessimistic of all styles are likely, once they
   fail, to have the symptoms of learned helplessness for a long time
   and across many endeavours, and to lose self-esteem.
1. (p. 78) A recipe for severe depression is preexisting pessimism
   encountering failure.
1. (p. 81) Although drugs and cognitive therapy both relieve depression,
   they work in quite different ways. Drugs seem to be activators, they
   push the patient up and out, but they do not make the world look any
   brighter. Cognitive therapy changes the way you look at things, and
   this new, optimistic style gets you up and around.
1. (p. 87) People who believe themselves stupid, rather than uneducated,
   don't take action to improve their minds.
1. (p. 88) The belief in self-improvement is a prophecy just as
   self-fulfilling as the old belief that character could not be
   changed.
1. (p. 89) What we consciously think is what mainly determines how we
   feel.
1. (p. 104) Optimism matters because is produces persistence.
1. (p. 201) **Human ethology** is a branch of biology that deals with
   observing people in the natural environment and noting in great
   detail what they do.
1. (p. 211, 217) ABCDE:
    - Adversity
    - Belief
    - Consequences
    - Disputation
    - Energization
1. (p. 221) The most convincing way of disputing a negative belief is to
   show that it is factually incorrect.
1. (p. 234) Childhood pessimism is the parent of adult pessimism.
1. (p. 258) It is crucial to learn an applicant's optimism level and fit
   him into the niche in which they can be most effective. [Some fields
   are better for optimists, and other for pessimisms, see written notes
   p. 11-12 for examples)
1. (p. 259) :star: Adversity is just the beginning of a challenging sequence
   that often leads to success.
1. (p. 259) The first thing we do when we encounter adversity is try to
   explain it. The explanations with which we interpret adversity to
   ourselves critically affect what we do next.
1. (p. 286) The epidemic of depression stems from the much-noted rise in
   individualism and the decline in the commitment to the common good.
1. (p. 292) You can *choose* to use optimism when you judge that less
   depression, or more achievement, or better health is the issue. But
   you can also choose not to use it, when you judge that clear sight or
   owning up is called for.
1. (p. 295) How is it possible for a depressed person both to believe he
   is to blame for the tragedies in his life *and* to believe he is
   helpless?
