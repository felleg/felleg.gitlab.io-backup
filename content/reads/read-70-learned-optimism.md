Are you a pessimist? How is that impacting your life? According to the
author of this book, it's probably impacting it a lot.

The foundational idea behind *Learned Optimism* is that the way we
explain our reality is the root cause of the actions we pose and the
choices we make in our daily lives (this reminded me of [Crucial
Conversations](/46)). For example, if you eat a chocolate bar two weeks into
a no-sugar-added diet, how you 
rationalize this "failure" will massively impact the outcome. If you
think, "I'm so weak, I can't even resist a chocolate bar. I'm pathetic,"
you might eat that entire chocolate cake sitting in your freezer while
watching the news. If, on the other hand, you say to yourself, "I stumbled on my
diet, yes, and this is proof of how hard this challenge of healthy
eating is. I have managed to reach my goals flawlessly for the past 2
weeks. I am proud of myself. I am improving," you have far better
chances at staying the course.

According to the theory, how pessimistic a thought is can be measured on
three dimensions: how personal, pervasive, and permanent it is. Thus,
thinking "I never do anything right" in the face of adversity is a very
pessimistic thought.  On the other hand, thinking "This is a great
opportunity for learning" is very optimistic, because it is external,
limited to the situation, and temporary.

It comes without surprise that optimists lead better, fuller, healthier
lives on average (the author has statistics to back up that claim). The
question then becomes, how can we exercise our brain to start thinking
differently? I believe this is where the book truly shines. The
suggested framework is called ABCDE:

- Adversity
- Belief
- Consequence
- Disputation
- Energization

When you face **adversity** (e.g. someone notices a mistake you made in
your work), your brain will react by unearthing a **belief** it holds
deeply (e.g. "I have no idea what I'm doing."). The **consequence** will
be an emotional state that often makes you lose control of the situation
(e.g. "I started feeling sick and felt paralyzed, I couldn't complete my
tasks.").

The first step is to notice these dynamics happening in your head. It's
difficult because it requires tuning in to your internal dialogue, which
we too often learn to push aside, but it can be done. Personally, since
starting to read this book, I paid more attention to my mental thoughts
in the advent of adversities and I was shocked at how vividly
pessimistic, even sarcastic, my thoughts were. They were truly making me
sick, and explained why so often I would choose "flight" instead of
"fight" in periods of crisis. There was a moment of
realization on a walk home from work where I had to stop and ponder,
"Is this really how I'm talking to myself? This can't continue." All my
life, I thought I was approaching life as a realist, when in fact I was
merely a pessimist.  It felt like something
clicked in my mind: no wonder I had so little grit for most of my life
if I had these lingering, toxic beliefs and thoughts in the back of my
mind.

So I started practicing **disputation**, which involves disproving
pessimistic thoughts by searching for evidence that suggests my
catastrophizing thoughts were overreactions. In a sense, I began
appreciating that reality was more complex than my initial impressions
suggested, and made me better at accepting ambiguity. The final step,
**energization**, comes naturally: after disputing a pessimistic
thought, you naturally feel empowered. Fear fades away, and you feel
like you start seeing clearly once more.

If there's one quote to remember from this book, for me it is:

> Adversity is just the beginning of a challenging sequence that often
> leads to success.

The book goes even further and nuances instances where pessimism might
be better than optimism, and explains that *learned* optimism is the
ability of choosing when to dispute our thoughts or not. The goal, as
always, is to achieve the right balance. Still, I think you will find a
clear path to deep mental change by simply starting to analyze your
inner dialogue to identify how permanent, pervasive and personal your
explanations of reality are.

# :star: Star quotes:

1. (p. 4) The defining characteristic of pessimists is that they tend to
   believe bad events will last a long time, will undermine everything
   they do, and are their own fault.
1. (p. 7) Our thoughts are not merely reactions to events; they change
   what ensues.
1. (p. 7) Pessimistic prophecies are self-fulfilling.
1. (p. 8) Habits of thinking need not be forever. One of the most
   significant findings in psychology in the last 20 years is that
   individuals can change the way they think.
1. (p. 15) :star: See events as successes or failures of personal control.
1. (p. 72) Love comes rarely in life, and if you waste your life mooning
   over its all too ordinary absence, you are bringing on your own
   depression. You are living under a tyranny of *shoulds*. Stop
   'should-ing' on yourself!
1. (p. 74) Emotion comes directly from what we think:
    - Think "I am in danger" and you feel anxiety.
    - Think "I am being trespassed against" and you feel danger.
    - Think "Loss" and you feel sadness.
1. (p. 75) How you think about your problems, including depression
   itself, will either relieve depression or aggravate it.
1. (p. 75) If your explanatory style is optimistic, your depression will
   be halted.
1. (p. 77) There is one particularly self-defeating way to think: making
   personal, permanent and pervasive explanations for bad events. People
   who have this most pessimistic of all styles are likely, once they
   fail, to have the symptoms of learned helplessness for a long time
   and across many endeavours, and to lose self-esteem.
1. (p. 78) A recipe for severe depression is preexisting pessimism
   encountering failure.
1. (p. 81) Although drugs and cognitive therapy both relieve depression,
   they work in quite different ways. Drugs seem to be activators, they
   push the patient up and out, but they do not make the world look any
   brighter. Cognitive therapy changes the way you look at things, and
   this new, optimistic style gets you up and around.
1. (p. 87) People who believe themselves stupid, rather than uneducated,
   don't take action to improve their minds.
1. (p. 88) The belief in self-improvement is a prophecy just as
   self-fulfilling as the old belief that character could not be
   changed.
1. (p. 89) What we consciously think is what mainly determines how we
   feel.
1. (p. 104) Optimism matters because is produces persistence.
1. (p. 201) **Human ethology** is a branch of biology that deals with
   observing people in the natural environment and noting in great
   detail what they do.
1. (p. 211, 217) ABCDE:
    - Adversity
    - Belief
    - Consequences
    - Disputation
    - Energization
1. (p. 221) The most convincing way of disputing a negative belief is to
   show that it is factually incorrect.
1. (p. 234) Childhood pessimism is the parent of adult pessimism.
1. (p. 258) It is crucial to learn an applicant's optimism level and fit
   him into the niche in which they can be most effective. [Some fields
   are better for optimists, and other for pessimisms, see written notes
   p. 11-12 for examples)
1. (p. 259) :star: Adversity is just the beginning of a challenging sequence
   that often leads to success.
1. (p. 259) The first thing we do when we encounter adversity is try to
   explain it. The explanations with which we interpret adversity to
   ourselves critically affect what we do next.
1. (p. 286) The epidemic of depression stems from the much-noted rise in
   individualism and the decline in the commitment to the common good.
1. (p. 292) You can *choose* to use optimism when you judge that less
   depression, or more achievement, or better health is the issue. But
   you can also choose not to use it, when you judge that clear sight or
   owning up is called for.
1. (p. 295) How is it possible for a depressed person both to believe he
   is to blame for the tragedies in his life *and* to believe he is
   helpless?
