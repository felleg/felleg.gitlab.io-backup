# [Overcoming Learning Anxiety](/overcoming-learning-anxiety)


This isn't a physical book yet! I have been working on this text for
almost two years I am strongly attached to it, enough to want to publish it as a real book. It tells the
story of how I overcame my own learning anxiety, the impact it had on my
life, and how I believe you can overcome yours if you suffer from the
same condition.

Here is a summary of the method I share in the text:

**The Steps**:
1. Read and highlight the golden nuggets
1. Write down your highlights
1. Find your Star Quotes
1. Write about your opinion of the book


**The Advanced Tips**:

1. Never go out without your book and pens
1. Grab your book before grabbing your phone
1. Start by reading a single book at a time
1. Track your progress by folding the corners
1. Use the body of your highlighter as a visual aid
1. Get the right grip
1. Use creative highlighting to help your future self take efficient notes
1. Use your book‚Äôs margins and blank pages to write ideas
1. Number your notebook‚Äôs pages
1. If your notebook doesn‚Äôt have margins, make some!
1. Write the source of your knowledge nuggets in your margins
1. Use a URL shortener to encode web links in your notebook
1. Give your book away
1. Share your notes online
1. Reading a book twice is inefficient
1. Love your hardware

# :star: Star quotes

1. Mental healing requires acknowledgement, and acknowledgement requires knowledge of the problem. The anxious learner is less likely to learn about their condition, because the idea of learning feels unsafe to them in the first place. It is a sadly ironic predicament.
1. Anyone can experience learning anxiety and solving it requires a system of your own creation that will make learning a joyful experience to you
1. Learning anxiety comes from being afraid to try something new for fear that it will be too difficult, that we will look stupid in the attempt, or that we will have to part from old habits that have worked for us in the past.
1. Learning anxieties are the basis for resistance to change.
1. "I had to overcome my learning anxiety in order to learn that this
   was exactly the problem holding me back."
1. The path to mastery of any type involves traversing the
   Dunning-Kruger graph.
1. Books are punching bags. If someone was standing in a gym next to their punching bag, you would probably understand that whatever damage the bag exhibits went directly into making that person stronger.
1. Don't think of books as decorations; think of them as food that
   nourishes your soul.
1. Stop respecting books, and start respecting how your brain learns.
1. When you listen passively to the radio while driving, all your mind
   really records is the ads.
1. We learn by doing.
1. You should never have to read a book or textbook more than once. If you take good notes, once you finish a book, you can consider yourself done with it.
1. "My library, if I were to have one, would be filled by books I wrote, and empty of books I read."
1. Each humbling failure is a step closer to mastery, and rejoice that you are making real progress.
1. Highlight whatever golden nuggets of information *you* find interesting
1. Reading diagonally is often tempting; writing diagonally is much more difficult to pull off.
1. The goal of producing complete notes is to allow you to unshackle from the book and claim this knowledge as your own.
1. "The only time I‚Äôll rephrase something is if I can make it shorter,
   or if I find the original sentence hard to understand."
1. The only sustainable competitive advantage is your ability to learn faster than the competition.
1. A book you chose almost certainly contains parts of the answer to the question that made you choose it.
1. We are all lifelong learners. If you want to learn about something, you can do it.
1. Nobody gets used to feeling dumb.
