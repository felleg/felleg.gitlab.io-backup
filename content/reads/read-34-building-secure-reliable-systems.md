 This is a book I have been intimidated by since it came out. I am proud
 of myself for having finished it! I think it's more meant to be
 reference material than actual reading material, to be fair. [You can
 browse the HTLM version of this book online for

# :star: Star quotes

1. (p. 62) Expecting perfection is an unrealistic assumption. Hope is
   not a strategy.
1. (p. 92) Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
1. (p. 144) Resilience is closely tied to recovery, but while recovery
   focuses on the ability to fix systems *after* they break, resilience
   is about designing systems that delay or withstand breakage.
1. (p. 309) Automation is a win-win, reducing toil while simultaneously
   increasing reliability and security. Rely on automation whenever
   possible.
