# Review

I had *The Culture Code* on my reading list for a long time, and I'm
glad I finally got to it. If anything, it reinforced my belief that
individual skills, although important, are not what really matters. What
matters is the interaction between people who possess individual skills.

The concept from the book that stuck most with me was "belonging cues".
They are the little things we do in conversation that communicate to
each other, "You are safe here." Everyone has their own style and their
own cues, and this allowed me to look inwards and reflect about how I
communicate with people that I appreciate they take the time to share
their thoughts with me. From the exterior, you could observe it as
looking in each others' eyes, adopting a listening stance, laughing
loudly, making fist bumps, etc. However, these cues can vary wildly, and probably depend
on which people are speaking together. When added together, these cues
create *chemistry*, which is probably a synonym for safety.

According to the author, a group with good chemistry will typically fill
its members with a sensation of excitement and deep comfort. I
think I have been in such groups before, and I agree. This is the type
of group within which you feel anything is possible. I would be willing
to bet that in a competitive environment, this is the type of group who
would go the furthest.

Learning about belonging cues was an "Aha!" moment for me, because I think
it is an important, elusive ingredient of psychological safety. For
example, when you look at someone, how long does it take you to guess if
this person is relaxed, happy, or stressed, angry? Typically, this is
information that our brain can process very quickly, and so belonging
cues are not something you can plan and strategize about. At best, you
can be aware of when you stumbled upon one.

The belonging cues are just the start, and the book explores various
successful cultures in many different spheres of life. By the end of the
book, the author writes, "It's possible for groups to solve extremely
complex problems using a few rules of thumb." I think that creating
healthy work cultures is one of the most complex problems of our
generation, and I like to believe that the author is right: given the
right rules of thumb (awareness of belonging cues, owning mistakes,
self-concordance, ...), the group can get there naturally, just like the
sailboat pushed to land by the right tailwind.

# :star: Star quotes

1. (p. 70) What mattered most in creating a successful team had less to do with
   intelligence and experience and more to do with where the desks were
   located.
2. (p. 81) Deciding who's in & who's out is the most powerful signal any group
   sends.
3. (p. 122) Everything is done as a group. There is no greater sin than losing
   track of someone.
4. (p. 127) Tamp down selfish instincts that might make you the center of
   attention
5. (p. 141) The most important four words any leader can say: "I screwed that
   up."
6. (p. 145) Being bulnerable together is the only way a team can become
   invulnerable.
7. (p. 151) Discovery has to do with asking the right question the right way.
8. (p. 159) As a leader, ask your people 3 questions:
    1. What is one thing that I currently do that you'l like me to
    continue to do?
    2. What is one thing that I don't currently do frequently enough that
    you think I should do more often?
    3. What can I do to make you more effective?
9. (p. 161) Two critical moments happen early in a group's life: the
   first vulnerability and the first disagreement. These are doorways to
   two possible group paths: Are we about appearing strong or about
   exploring the landscape together? Are we about winning interactions
   or about learning together?
10. (p. 166) Creting habits of vulnerability requires a group to endure
    two discomforts: emotional pain and a sense of inefficiency.
1. (p. 193) One of the best measures of any group's culture is its
   learning velocity: how quickly it improves its performance of a new
   skill.
1. (p. 211) We assume that because we're complex, that the way we make
   desisions must also be complex. It's possible for groups to solve
   extremely complex problems using a few rules of thumb.
1. (p. 212) The road to success is paved with mistakes well-handled.
