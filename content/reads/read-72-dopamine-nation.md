# :star: Star quotes:

1. (p. 41) Boredom is not just boring. It can also be terrifying. It
   forces us to come face-to-face with bigger questions of meaning and
   purpose. But boredom is also an opportunity for discovery and
   invention. It creates the space necesasry for a new thought to form,
   without which we're endlessly reacting to stimuli around us rather
   than allowing ourselves to be within our lived experiences.
1. (p. 43) "Many of my patients use drugs, prescribed or otherwise, to
   compensate for a basic lack of self-care, then attribute the costs to
   a mental illness, thus necessitating the need for more drugs. Hence
   poisons become vitamins."
