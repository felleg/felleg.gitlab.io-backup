# Review

For a long time, I have felt like I was more prone to addiction than
most people around me. Personal examples abound:

- how intense [my video game collecting](/selling-collection) used to be in the past
- how much time I spent [creating content for FlashFlashRevolution](/my-ffr-journey)
- how quickly [my reading hobby](/allreads) suddenly took over my life
- my amount of time wasted on Newgrounds, YouTube, and the likes
- my amount of time listening to Spotify and [creating playlists](/spotify)

# :star: Star quotes:

1. (p. 41) Boredom is not just boring. It can also be terrifying. It
   forces us to come face-to-face with bigger questions of meaning and
   purpose. But boredom is also an opportunity for discovery and
   invention. It creates the space necessary for a new thought to form,
   without which we're endlessly reacting to stimuli around us rather
   than allowing ourselves to be within our lived experiences.
1. (p. 43) "Many of my patients use drugs, prescribed or otherwise, to
   compensate for a basic lack of self-care, then attribute the costs to
   a mental illness, thus necessitating the need for more drugs. Hence
   poisons become vitamins."
1. (p. 46) The reason we're all so miserable may be because we're
   working so hard to avoid being miserable.
1. (p. 50) Pleasure and pain work like a balance. The balance does not
   want to be tipped for very long to one side or another. Hence, every
   time the balance tips toward pleasure, powerful self-regulating
   mechanisms kick into action to bring it level again. These
   self-regulating mechanisms do not require conscious thought or an act
   of will. They just happen, like a reflex.
1. (p. 57) The paradox is that **hedonism**, the pursuit of pleasure for
   its own safe, leads to **anhedonia**, which is the inability to enjoy
   pleasure of any kind.
1. (p. On social media apps, the response of others is so capricious and
   unpredictable that the uncertainty of getting a "like" or some
   equivalent is as reinforcing as the "like" itself.
1. (p. 66) With prolonged and repeated exposure to pleasurable stimuli,
   our capacity to tolerate pain decreases, and our threshold for
   experiencing pleasure increases.
1. (p. 76) A month is usually the minimum amount of time it takes to
   reset the brain's reward pathway.
1. (p. 82) **Mindfulness** is the ability to observe what our brain is
   doing while it's doing it, without judgement. It demands that we see
   our thoughts and emotions as separate from us and yet,
   simultaneously, part of us. Reserving judgement is important to
   mindfulness because as soon as we start condemning what our brain is
   doing ("Eww!"), we stop being able to observe.
1. (p. 88)
    - D = Data
    - O = Objectives for using
    - P = Problems related to use
    - A = Abstinence
    - M = Mindfulness
    - I = Insight into our behaviors
    - N = Next steps after a month of abstinence
    - E = Experiment pleasure in many different forms
1. (p. 92) Three types of self-binding:
    - Physical strategies (space)
    - Chronological strategies (time)
    - Categorical strategies (meaning)
1. (p. 107) For addicts, the drug becomes the reward when they succeed
   and the consolation prize when they fail.
1. (p. 112) Categorical self-binding fails when we inadvertently include
   a trigger in our list of acceptable activities.
1. (p. 118) Binding ourselves is a way to be free.
1. (p. 142) Try ending a hot shower with at least a minute of cold
   shower.
1. (p. 152) Our contemporary preoccupation with sex may be because it's
   the last physical activity still widely practiced.
1. (p. 171) All my patients who have achieved long-term recovery have
   relied on truth-telling as critical for sustained mental and physical
   health.
1. (p. 176) Radical honesty:
    - promotes awareness of our actions
    - fosters intimate human connections
    - leads to a truthful autobiography, which holds us accountable not
      just to our present but also to our future selves
    - is contagious, and might even prevent the development of future
      addiction
1. (p. 181) "What would you be giving up if you stopped **that**
   behavior? What is one step you can take to change **that** behavior?"
1. (p. 184) Consuming leads to isolation and indifference, as the drug
   comes to replace the reward obtained from being in relationship with
   others.
1. (p. 187) :star: "I am responsible."
1. (p. 193) "Hunger is a notification I can ignore."
1. (p. 194) Truth-telling engenders a plenty mindset. Lying engenders a
   scarcity mindset.
1. (p. 210) To truly understand someone is to care for them.
1. (p. 215) **Destructive shame**:
    1. Overconsumption
    1. Shame
    1. Lying
    1. Isolation
    1. (Go back to step 1) Overconsumption...
1. (p. 217) **Prosocial shame**:
    1. Overconsumption
    1. Shame
    1. Radical honesty
    1. Acceptance
    1. Belonging and decreased consumption.
1. (p. 227) It is not our perfection but out willingness to work
   together to remedy our mistakes that creates the intimacy we crave.
1. (p. 233) We must be willing to move forward despite being uncertain
   of what lies ahead.
1. (p. 233) :star: We must have faith that actions today that seem to have no
   impact in the present moment are in fact accumulating in a positive
   direction, which will be revealed to us only at some unknown time in
   the future.
