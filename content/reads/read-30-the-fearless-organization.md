# Review

Incredibly relevant. I want to work for an organization that values psychological safety. The author makes it clear that it is one of the best investments money can't buy.

# :star: Star quotes

1. (p. 20) A survey on psychological safety to measure it at
   your organization (note: questions with (R) are reversed,
   meaning disagreement on those equals higher psychological
   safety) (note 2: score these on a 5 or 7 point Likert
   scale)
    1. If you make a mistake on this team, it is often held
       against you. (R)
    1. Members of this team are able to bring up problems
       and tough issues.
    1. People on this team reject others for being
       different. (R)
    1. It is safe to take a risk on this team.
    1. It is difficult to ask other members of this team for
       help. (R)
    1. No one on this team would deliberately act in a way
       that undermines my efforts.
    1. Working with members of this team, my unique skills
       and talents are valued and utilized.
1. (p. 22) Making the environment safe for open
   communication about challenges, concerns and
   opportunities is one of the most important leadership
   responsibilities in the 21st century.
1. (p. 25) Your greatest fear as a CEO is that people aren't
   telling you the truth.
1. (p. 45) The failure of an employee to speak up in a
   crucial moment cannot be seen. Because *not* offering an
   idea is an invisible act, it's hard to engage in
   real-time course correction. This means that
   psychologically safe workplaces have a powerful advantage
   in competitive industries.
1. (p. 138) Speaking up is easier said than done.
1. (p. 189) Substituting candor for silence and engagement
   for fear are essential responsibilities for leaders
   today.
1. (p. 194) Mistakes themselves are not a bad thing. The
   question is, do you learn from those mistakes?
