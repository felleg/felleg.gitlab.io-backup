# Review

This book is an absolute classic in the world of contemporary
psychology. Written in 1959 and only 163 pages long in its 2006 edition,
it packs a punch that is as relevant today as it was on the first day of
its publication, I'm sure.

This book is split in two parts.  In the first part, the author first recounts the three
years he spent across four concentration camps, including Auschwitz. The
conditions he describes there are absolutely horrific. Some of the
details he shares absolutely got under my skin, no matter how
desensitized I thought our modern day Internet had made me:
- How 90% of the people getting of the train at a concentration camp
  were immediately sent to gas chambers, based on the whim of a
  single German soldier.
- How the head of an inmate made a "rattling noise" against the
  stairs as his corpse was unceremoniously dragged by its feet
  outside the hut.
- How a very strict camp ruling that forbade any efforts to save a
  man who attempted suicide.
- etc.

Without exaggeration, the scenes described by
the author are more than inhuman, they are unimaginable. Repeatedly, I
would pause my lecture and wonder, who would ever want to hurt another
human *that bad*, and for what?

In the second part of the book, the author goes more in detail about the inner
workings of **logotherapy**, which is therapy aimed at finding meaning
in the patient's life. Indeed, *logos* is a Greek word which denotes
"meaning." He recalls both from his very personal experience in
concentration camps and his experience with patients that having a
meaning to live for makes all the difference in the hourly, daily
problems that life throws at us. Meaning is something we can anchor
ourselves to. For example, it can be in work, in love, or in courage in
the face of a challenging situation. If we know that someone we love
awaits our return, or that we have an unfinished work we wish to return
to, we are much more likely to find the motivation within ourselves to
survive our ordeals. We can turn a tragedy into a triumph.

It seems to me that now more than ever our society seems to prioritize
comfort over meaning, and I believe this to be the source of much of our
neuroses. This perspective relates to other books I enjoyed, e.g. [The
Mountain is You](/88), [Start With Why](/26), [Drive](/63), [The Art of
Happiness](/59), [Four Thousand Weeks](/9), [The Subtle Art of Not
Giving a Fuck](/2), and maybe even [En as-tu vraiment besoin?](/8). It
seems that Frankl is tapping into an eternal problem of humanity with
logotherapy. Every new human on earth has to realize on their quest to
meaning that life brings no answers, and that the meaning that will
allow them work through their suffering lies within themself.

To summarize, as Nietzsche put it, "He who has a *why* to live for can
bear for can bear with almost any *how*." By never losing sight of why
what we do matters, we always have something to live for, and by
extension a reason to fight for survival.  It opens us to new ways of
living, it opens us to learning, which is ultimately what allows us to
overcome our problems.

I remember a time when my life had
no meaning, only three years ago. I was lost and I kept self-sabotaging
my opportunities. Reading books, learning from others and sharing wisdom
has been my most life-changing experience yet and completely redefined
who I thought I was. It gave me meaning! Thus, I can only agree with
Frankl's view that one's found meaning seems to be the cure to the
majority of mental ailments. Finding my meaning felt like getting my
soul back. I hope I'll get the opportunity to help someone find their
meaning someday. That could change the world as we know it, who knows!

1. (p. 77) We need to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead
   to think of ourselves as those who are being questioned by life --
   daily and hourly. Our answer must consist, not in talks and
   meditation, but in right action and in right conduct.
1. (p. 77) Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the
   right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it
   constantly sets for each individual.
1. (p. 78) There is no need to be ashamed of tears, for tears bear
   witness that a man has the greatest of courage, the courage to
   suffer.
1. (p. 80) A man who becomes conscious of the responsibility he bears

   suffering is unavoidable. To suffer unnecessarily is masochistic
   rather than heroic.
1. (p. 119) Procreation is not the only meaning of life, for then life

   meaningless cannot be rendered meaningful merely by its perpetuation.
1. (p. 122) "Instead of possibilities, I have realities in my past, not
   only the reality of work done and of love loved, but of sufferings

   with suffering.
1. (p. 160) One's approach to everything from life-threatening
   challenges to everyday situations helps to shape the meaning of our
   lives.
