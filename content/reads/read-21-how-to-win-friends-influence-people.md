# Review

Groundbreaking for its time, and still relevant today. Good tips about
how to listen to people and get them to think about your ideas. (Thanks
Raymond for this recommendation!)

# :star: Star quotes

1. (p. 81) "I had listened intently. I had listened because I was
   genuinely interested. And he felt it. Naturally that pleased him.
   That kind of listening is one of the highest compliments we can pay
   anyone."
1. (p. 110) There is only one way to get the best of an argument and
   that is to avoid it.
1. (p. 111) A man convinced against his will is of the same opinion
   still.
1. (p. 112) Which would you rather have, an academic, theatrical
   victory, or a person's good will? You can seldom have both.
1. (p. 114) You can measure the size of a person by what makes them
   angry.
1. (p. 130) There is a certain degree of satisfaction in having the
   courage to admit one's errors. It not only clears the air of guilt
   and defensiveness, but often helps solve the problem created by the
   error.
1. (p. 133) Let's admit our mistakes quickly and with enthusiasm.
1. (p. 161) If you say to yourself, "How would I feel/react if I were in
   their shoes?", you will save yourself time and irritation, for by
   becoming interested in the cause, we are less likely to dislike the
   effect.
