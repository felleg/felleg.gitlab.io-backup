# :star: Star quotes
1. (p. 5) The 2017 Forrester report states "DevOps is accelerating
   technology, but organizations often overestimate their progress, and
   executives are especially prone to overestimating their progress
   compared to those actually doing the work."
1. (p. 13) Don't reward busywork that doesn't actually achieve
   organizational goals
1. (p. 14) The "fuzzy front end" is the nickname for the design part of
   the lead time. It's often unclear when to start the clock, and there
   is high variability.
1. (p. 30) The organizational culture predicts the way information flows
   through an organization.
1. (p. 31) The characteristics of "good information":
    - It provides answers to the questions that the receiver needs
      answered
    - It is timely (arrives at the right time)
    - It is presented in a way that can be used by the receiver
1. (p. 36) A good culture requires trust and cooperation between people
   cross the organization, so it reflects the level of collaboration and
   trust inside the organization.
1. (p. 39) The way to change culture is not to first change how people
   think, but instead to start by changing how people behave (what they
   *do*)
1. (p. 42) A key goal of continuous delivery is changing the economics
   of the software delivery process so the cost of pushing out
   individual changes is very low.
1. (p. 47) We create an environment where developers accept
   responsibility for global outcomes (e.g. quality and stability) by:
    - giving devs tools to detect problems when they occur
    - giving devs the time and resources to invest in their own
      development
    - giving devs the authority to fix problems straight away
