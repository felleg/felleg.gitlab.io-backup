# :star: Star quotes:

1. (p. 34) During a period of expansion, two parallel realities develop,
   one inside the bubble and one outside. The more the bubble grows, the
   more people are drawn into its powerful reinforcing beliefs and
   perceptions. Eventually, those inside the bubble become so absorbed
   by their reality that they literally can no longer understand the
   point of view of those outside.
1. (p. 38) A core principle of a regenerative society is that life creates
   conditions for life.
1. (p. 46) If you want to teach people a new way of thinking, don't
   bother to teach them. Instead, give them a tool, the use of which
   will lead to new ways of thinking.
1. (p. 49) A common reason for the shortfall of successful collaboration
   is the return of well-established bad habits that eventually take
   over, such as:
    - avoiding conflict
    - launching into debates that merely reinforce previously held views
1. (p. 76) :star: How we make our decisions is as important as the
   decisions themselves.
1. (p. 115) The path to full integration of sustainability into the
   organization's strategy and purpose (1 -> 2 is reactive, 3 -> 4 is
   pro-active. The most significant jump is to move beyond stage 3):
    1. Non-compliance
    1. Compliance
        - Regulatory demands / enforcement
        - Public pressure
    1. Beyond compliance
        - Eco-efficiencies
        - Regulatory threat
        - PR crisis
    1. Integrated strategy
        - Business opportunities
        - Risk management
    1. Purpose / Mission
        - Align with core values
1. (p. 120) The four elements of shareholder value:
    - (Internal-Today) Cost & risk reduction
    - (External-Today) Regulation and legitimacy
    - (Internal-Tomorrow) Innovation and repositioning
    - (External-Tomorrow) Growth path and trajectory
1. (p. 122) The Sustainable Value Framework, which goes into more
   details than the four elements listed above:

1. (p. 132) If experimental and societal good come at the expense of a
   company's financial performance, then it is not practicing a
   sustainable business strategy.
1. (p. 133) What's good for business *must* be good for the environment
   and for people worldwide or you are not moving toward sustainable
   growth.
1. (p. 171) Give a man a fish and he will be fed; Teach him how to fish
   and he will feed himself; Give him a fishing business and he will
   overfish.
1. (p. 174) The iceberg of ways of explaining reality (from surface to
   deeper, increased leverage and opportunity for learning):
    - Events (React, above surface)
        - "What just happened?"
    - Patterns/trends (Anticipate, surface level)
        - "What's been happening?"
        - "Have web been here or some place similar before?"
    - Systemic structures (Design, below surface)
        - What forces are at play contributing to these patterns?
    - Mental models (Transform, bottom iceberg)
        - What about our thinking allows this situation to persist?
1. (p. 184) Say your assumptions out loud (e.g. "We are assuming that
   there will be no tax on emissions, or that if there were, airlines
   would be exempt.") Then ask yourself, What would happen if that
   assumption turned out to be wrong?
1. (p. 184) Inquiry is a far more effective strategy than advocacy in
   expanding the boundaries of people's thinking.
1. (p. 184) Questions for making the current boundaries in thinking explicit:
    - What are the key factors in the problem we are facing?
    - What is going on right now and what forces are likely to shape the
      future?
    - Who are the key actors or decision makers in the system, including
      those with less authority?
    - In what ways are we imposing arbitrary boundaries?
    - Why do we assume that a certain person is the decision maker? Is
      it because the most obvious problem symptoms are in their
      organization?
    - What is the implicit time horizon built into the current
      definition of the problem you're facing? How would this shift if you doubled that time frame, or made it 10 or 20 years longer?
1. (p. 186) Help people get a feeling for challenging their own assumed
   boundaries and they will usually start doing it on their own more
   regularly.
1. (p. 212) **Technical nutrients** are materials that can circulate
   back into the creation or use of other products.
1. (p. 215) There is potential value in a waste stream that may have
   never been considered before.
1. (p. 236) Once 20% of a population begin moving in the same direction,
   they act as a tipping point for more change in that direction.
1. (p. 243) While it might be a natural instinct to try to convince
   those who show little interest in the questions you are pursuing, or
   to obsess about particular people or roles you feel are crucial, it
   is usually more effective to look for those who seem to understand
   the importance of the issue right away. Look for those with whom you
   sense "a connection", and who are willing to "go deeper."
1. (p. 245) Make your own concerns and aspirations clear and come to
   learn, rather than to advocate or sell your ideas. The person with
   whom you are about to talk could really be a teacher for you.
1. (p. 255) When teams or working groups get stuck in unproductive
   conversations, it is because members have moved up their ladder of
   inference and cannot get back down:
    - I take **actions** based on my beliefs
    - I adopt **beliefs** about the world (note: our beliefs affect what
      *data* we select next time)
    - I draw **conclusions**
    - I make **assumptions** based on the meaning I added
    - I add **meaning** (cultural and personal)
    - I select **data** based from what I observe (and my *beliefs*)
    - **Observable data and experiences**, as would be recorded by a
      camera.
1. (p. 268) Your ability to foster commitment will never be greater than
   your own commitment. The key in fostering shared commitment lies in
   connecting to what you care about and what the organization cares
   about, and gradually knitting the two together.
1. (p. 275) The work of innovators comes down to helping people
   recognize that seeing systems ultimately means seeing one another.
1. (p. 276) The **Four Types of Conversational Action**:
    - Mover -- Initiate a sequence of actions (provides direction)
    - Opposer -- Oppose an action (provides correction)
    - Follower -- Support an action (provides completion)
    - Bystander -- Observe, ask questions, make comments (provides
      perspective)
1. (p. 279) Stuck teams typically fall in one of these patterns:
    - Yes-men: One or two powerful figures emerge, and the rest follow
      their lead without questioning
    - Death by meeting: A few people do all the talking, transforming
      the rest of the group into disabled bystanders
    - "What are we doing here?": No one takes a stand on an issue (i.e.
      no effective *movers*), so there is no clear path forward
    - The debating society: People get stuck in "move-oppose" dynamics
      and rarely suspend or shift predetermined positions
1. (p. 286) No matter how difficult the design challenge, *natural
   systems* provide 3.5 billion years of experimentation we can draw on.
1. (p. 293) **Fear cramps imagination**: Change strategies based on
   reacting to threats limit the commitment, imagination, and collective
   intelligence needed for ongoing innovation.
1. (p. 297) Doing less harm differs from working to create what we truly
   seek. If a car is heading south, slowing does does not cause it to go
   north. No matter how "less bad" you are, it will not make you "good."
1. (p. 324) **It's not what the vision is, it's what the vision does**:
   People and groups obsess about "getting the vision right," but often
   miss the whole point of vision as an active force, not just a set of
   words.
1. (p. 326) Profit for a company is like oxygen for a person. You need
   it to survive. Unfortunately, most businesses operate as if their
   purpose is breathing.
1. (p. 332) At the end of the day, ask yourself, "How did our vision
   influence our actions?" If the answer is "It didn't," the vision is
   just words.
1. (p. 337) When managers and staff members are aligned, they aren't
   working at cross-purposes. They're working toward the same end but
   with different accountabilities and authorities, designed so all
   contributions have a tangible positive impact.
1. (p. 339) Organizations get the results they are designed for, and no
   more.
1. (p. 368) The opposite of fatalism is deep conviction in the power of
   personal choice.
