# :star: Star quotes:

1. (p. 34) During a period of expansion, two parallel realities develop,
   one inside the bubble and one outside. The more the bubble grows, the
   more people are drawn into its powerful reinforcing beliefs and
   perceptions. Eventually, those inside the bubble become so absorbed
   by their reality that they literally can no longer understand the
   point of view of those outside.
1. (p. 38) A core principle of a regenerative society is that life creates
   conditions for life.
1. (p. 46) If you want to teach people a new way of thinking, don't
   bother to teach them. Instead, give them a tool, the use of which
   will lead to new ways of thinking.
1. (p. 49) A common reason for the shortfall of successful collaboration
   is the return of well-established bad habits that eventually take
   over, such as:
    - avoiding conflict
    - launching into debates that merely reinforce previously held views
1. (p. 76) :star: How we make our decisions is as important as the
   decisions themselves.
