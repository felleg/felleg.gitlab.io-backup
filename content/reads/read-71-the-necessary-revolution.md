# :star: Star quotes:

1. (p. 34) During a period of expansion, two parallel realities develop,
   one inside the bubble and one outside. The more the bubble grows, the
   more people are drawn into its powerful reinforcing beliefs and
   perceptions. Eventually, those inside the bubble become so absorbed
   by their reality that they literally can no longer understand the
   point of view of those outside.
1. (p. 38) A core principle of a regenerative society is that life creates
   conditions for life.
1. (p. 46) If you want to teach people a new way of thinking, don't
   bother to teach them. Instead, give them a tool, the use of which
   will lead to new ways of thinking.
1. (p. 49) A common reason for the shortfall of successful collaboration
   is the return of well-established bad habits that eventually take
   over, such as:
    - avoiding conflict
    - launching into debates that merely reinforce previously held views
1. (p. 76) :star: How we make our decisions is as important as the
   decisions themselves.
1. (p. 115) The path to full integration of sustainability into the
   organization's strategy and purpose (1 -> 2 is reactive, 3 -> 4 is
   pro-active. The most significant jump is to move beyond stage 3):
    1. Non-compliance
    1. Compliance
        - Regulatory demands / enforcement
        - Public pressure
    1. Beyond compliance
        - Eco-efficiencies
        - Regulatory threat
        - PR crisis
    1. Integrated strategy
        - Business opportunities
        - Risk management
    1. Purpose / Mission
        - Align with core values
1. (p. 120) The four elements of shareholder value:
    - (Internal-Today) Cost & risk reduction
    - (External-Today) Regulation and legitimacy
    - (Internal-Tomorrow) Innovation and repositioning
    - (External-Tomorrow) Growth path and trajectory
1. (p. 122) The Sustainable Value Framework, which goes into more
   details than the four elements listed above:

1. (p. 132) If experimental and societal good come at the expense of a
   company's financial performance, then it is not practicing a
   sustainable business strategy.
1. (p. 133) What's good for business *must* be good for the environment
   and for people worldwide or you are not moving toward sustainable
   growth.
1. (p. 171) Give a man a fish and he will be fed; Teach him how to fish
   and he will feed himself; Give him a fishing business and he will
   overfish.
1. (p. 184) Say your assumptions out loud (e.g. "We are assuming that
   there will be no tax on emissions, or that if there were, airlines
   would be exempt.") Then ask yourself, What would happen if that
   assumption turned out to be wrong?
