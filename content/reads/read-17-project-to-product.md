# Review

Revolutionary. The author gives a true recipe for connecting IT with the business in any organization.

# :star: Star quotes

1. (p. 40) Investments made in areas other than the bottleneck are
   futile.
1. (p. 49) In the codebase, every change to every line of code should
   have traceability back to its originating feature or defect. Adding
   traceability after the fact is difficult and error prone.
1. (p. 61) IT feels like a black box in many organizations due to the
   mismatch of the data models that IT vs the business use to operate.
1. (p. 61) **Watermelon projects**: When engineering leads are asked by
   project managers if they are on track, the answer is "yes" because
   the question is ambiguous. Projects looked green from the outside,
   but were red inside, like a watermelon.
1. (p. 75) It is impossible for the business to have a shared
   understanding of a bottleneck without having a shared understanding
   of productivity.
1. (p. 78) The four types of flow items:
    - Features
    - Defects
    - Risks
    - Debts
1. (p. 80) The Value Stream Network itself needs to be treated as a
   product, with its own stable delivery team, and not as a project with
   a defined end.
1. (p. 97) The five flow metrics:
    - Flow Distribution
    - Flow Velocity
    - Flow Time (includes both active and wait time)
    - Flow Load
    - Flow Efficiency
1. (p. 97) The zero-sum game of flow distribution trade-offs forces the
   business to make the kinds of trade-offs that the development team
   lead has to make constantly as unplanned work enters the value
   stream.
1. (p. 101) Flow value metrics are more suited to track productivity and
   delivery trends *within* a value stream than *across* value streams.
1. (p. 104) While separating flow time from lead time is important for
   products with large backlogs of customer requests, for products with
   smaller backlogs the two metrics will be more closely converged.
1. (p. 107) Flow load is the leading indicator of the point at which
   taking on too many flow items in parallel reduces output.
1. (p. 114) Business result metrics:
    - Value: Benefit to the business provided by the value stream
    - Cost: Cost of the value stream to the business
    - Quality: Product quality produced by value stream as perceived by
      customer
    - Happiness: Engagement of the staff working on the value stream.
1. (p. 122) The goal of the Flow Framework is to ensure that there is at
   least one metric supporting each of the business results and that
   each metric is tracked across the org for each value stream.
1. (p. 183) The structure of value streams is much more similar to an
   airline network than a manufacturing line. The airline network is a
   better metaphor.
1. (p. 184) In network management, bottlenecks are constraints that you
   simply reroute around. The flow does not need to stop as it does in a
   linear process. This is what makes them harder to catch.
1. (p. 190) As long as a developer tool like Jira is not connected to a
   service-desk tool like ServiceNow, the corresponding lack of flow and
   feedback between those two silos creates an information bottleneck.
   This is where the **connectivity index** comes into play, it's a
   measure of the degree to which information can flow end to end across
   value streams.
1. (p. 197) Different value streams may have different tolerances for
   flow load.
1. (p. 215) The **Flow Framework** is a framework for managing softeare
   delivery that is focused on measuring and optimizing the flow of
   business value through product-oriented software value streams that
   are correlated to business results.
