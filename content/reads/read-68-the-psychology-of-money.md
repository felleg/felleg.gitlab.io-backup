# :star: Star quotes:

1. (p. xi) :star: A genius is the person who can do the average thing when
   everyone else is losing their mind.
1. (p. 33) The more extreme the outcome, the less likely you can apply
   its lessons to your own life, because the more likely the outcome was
   influenced by extreme ends of luck or risk.
1. (p. 41) Happiness is just results minus expectations.
1. (p. 42) "Enough" is realizing that an insatiable appetite for more
   will push you to the point of regret.
1. (p. 83) The highest form of wealth is the ability to wake up every
   morning and say, "I can do whatever I want today."
1. (p. 85) Doing something you love on a schedule you can't control can
   fell the same as doing something you hate.
1. (p. 106) One of the most powerful ways to increase your savings isn't

1. (p. 139) A margin of safety is the only effective way to navigate a
   world that is governed by odds, not certainties.
1. (p. 142) "For my own investments, I assume the future returns I'll
   earn in my lifetime will be 30% lower than the historic average. So I
   save more than I would if I assumed the future will resemble the
   past. It's my margin of safety."
1. (p. 145) The biggest point of failure with money is a sole reliance
   on a paycheck to fund short-term spending needs, with no savings to
   create a gap between what you think your expenses are and what they
   might be in the future.
1. (p. 147) Long-term planning is harder than it seems because people's
   goals and desires change over time.
1. (p. 152) Assuming you'll be happy with a very low income, or choosing
   to work endless hours in pursuit of a high one, increases the odds
   that you'll one day find yourself at a point of regret.
1. (p. 171) Financial bubbles do their damage when long-term investors
   playing one game start taking cues from those short-term traders
   playing another.
1. (p. 198) Where there is selection there is art.
1. (p. 216) True success is exiting some rat race to modulate one's
   activities for peace of mind.
1. (p. 232) Expectations always move slower than facts.
