# Review

I have read my share of personal finance books in the past, [Les
millionaires ne sont pas ceux que vous croyez](/4), [Millionaire
Teacher](/5), [The Wealthy Barber Returns](/6), [Libert√© 45](/7), [En
as-tu vraiment besoin](/8), and [La facture amoureuse](/10). While I
wouldn't consider myself an expert in saving and investing, I think I've
got the basic knowledge required to make it out there. I've been looking
at the [million dollar grid](/million) for the past couple years and
using it as a reminder of the strength of compounding interest. I have
confidence in my investing strategy and have a long term investment
horizon.

What then did I learn from reading *The Psychology of Money*?

To tell you the truth, at first glance, not much. The book contains a
lot of common sense that, while surely instrumental for first time
readers of personal finance, had no hope of blowing the socks off
someone who had already read six books on the subject prior. Luckily,
though, and as you'll see below, the real book's strength was how it
managed to condense wisdom related to investing into short, powerful
quotes, that have the potential to save you from making bad decisions if
you say them out loud to yourself. It helps us understand our often strange, irrational behaviors around money and helps us reframe them in a more healthy way.

This book is not interested in giving you advice on diversifying your
portfolio beyond "consider index funds." What it *will* attempt to teach
the reader is not to risk what they have and need for a *chance* at
getting what they don't have and don't need. In my opinion, that's an
infinitely more valuable lesson.

I definitely recommend this short and sweet book for anyone looking to minimize their
regrets in association to money.

   everyone else is losing their mind.

1. (p. 145) The biggest point of failure with money is a sole reliance
