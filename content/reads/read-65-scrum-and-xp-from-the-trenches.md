Henrik Kniberg is an OG. After joining the board of directors of the
Agile Alliance in 2009, he served as an Agile/Lean coach at Spotify and
LEGO Group between 2012 and 2016. In this second edition of his 2007
book, re-published in 2015, he revisits and comments on all the things
he learned about the Agile and XP methodologies from his past
experiences "from the trenches".

In his writing, Kniberg is clearly doing his best to translate the tacit
knowledge he accumulated over the years in a tight package. Instead of
having a prescriptive approach or
saying something akin to "your mileage may vary" and leaving it at that,
he deliberately emphasizes what worked for *him* and his teams, what he
tried, where he failed and where he found success. In a way, it
sort of reminds me about my own blog post
[Overcoming Learning Anxiety](/overcoming-learning-anxiety).

Therefore, I found that the best way to read this book was to use it as
a report of how *specific* implementations of Scrum managed to transform
some teams for the better. Not all advice found in this book will be
immediately applicable to your team or your company (especially in
today's mostly hybrid world, which was not the norm in 2015 as far as I
know). There is no "right way" to do Scrum, but the methods described in
the book feel *right*. What's most interesting is how these methods build on top
of each other to allow the teams led by Kniberg to be truly agile. I
think the big takeaway from the book is that Scrum is more than the sum
of its parts: having a sprint planning, a board and a retrospective is
not enough. We also need to manage and understand how these tools
interact with each other, and adapt it to our reality.

In conclusion, if you've been doing Scrum for a while and want to
compare with how some of the most agile teams in the tech industry used
to do it, look no further!

:star: Star quotes:

1. (p. 20) Everything in Scrum is time-boxed.
1. (p. 84) Without retrospectives, you will find that the team keeps
   making the same mistakes over and over again.
1. (p. 108) If you are stuck with having to do manual regression
   testing, and want to automate this away, don't (unless it is really
   easy). Instead, build stuff that makes manual regression testing
   easier. *Then* consider automating the actual testing.
