# Review

Reading this was an almost religious experience. As I was taking my notes, I could feel myself going through some of the mental steps and blockages outlined in the book. This was probably my most challenging read yet, as it truly tested my reading system. Now that I made it through, I feel stronger than ever. What a ride! (Thanks Marcel for this recommendation!)

# :star: Star quotes

1. (p. 16) Everything that happens to you is a form of
   inhstruction if you pay attention.
1. (p. 25) Just as a well-filled day brings blessed sleep, so a
   well-employed life brings a blessed death.
1. (p. 38) Realize as early as possible that you have chosen your
   career for the wrong reasons, before your confidence takes a
   hit.
1. (p. 45) Do not envy those who seem to be naturally gifted; it
   is often a curse, as such types rarely learn the value of
   diligence and focus, and they pay for this later in life.
1. (p. 57) Procedural and political rules may be dysfunctional or
   counterproductive, but your job is not to moralize about this
   or complain. Understand them to get a complete lay of the
   land, like studying an alien culture. You are not there to
   change that culture; you will only end up being killed
   (fired). Later, when you have attained power and mastery, you
   will be the one to rewrite or destroy these same rules.
1. (p. 59) **Tacit knowledge** is a felling for what you are
   doing that is hard to put into words but easy to demonstrate
   in action.
1. (p. 60) The initial stages of learning a skill inevitably involve
   tedium. You must accept it and embrace it. Much as with physical
   exercise, you can even get a kind of perverse pleasure out of this
   pain, knowing the benefits it will bring you.
1. (p. 62) When you develop patience, boredom no longer signals the need
   for distraction, but rather the need for new challenges to conquer.
1. (p. 63) The future in science does not lie in increased
   specialization, but rather in the combining and cross-fertilization
   of knowledge in various fields. The future belongs to those who learn
   more skills and combine them in creative ways.
1. (p. 77) The only real impediment to mastering a skill is
   yourself and your emotions -- boredom, panic, frustration,
   insecurity. You cannot suppress such emotions. They are normal
   to the process and experienced by everyone, including Masters.
   What you can do is have faith in the process.
1. (p. 84) It is a curse to have everything go right on your
   first attempt. You will fail to question the element of luck,
   making you think you have the golden touch. When you do
   inevitably fail, it will confuse and demoralize you past the
   point of learning.
1. (p. 103) Mentors do not give you a shortcut, but they
   streamline the process. They can direct you away from
   unnecessary side paths or errors. Their advice is tailored to
   your circumstances and your needs.
1. (p. 106) The best mentors are often those who have wide
   knowledge and experience, and are not overly specialized in
   their field -- they can train you to think on a higher level,
   and to make connections between different forms of knowledge.
1. (p. 107) Books can serve as temporary mentors. You will want
   to convert such books and writers into living mentors by:
    - personalizing their voice,
    - interacting with the material,
    - taking notes or writing in the margins
1. (p. 115) The problem with all students is that they inevitably
   *stop* somewhere. They hear an idea and they hold on to it
   until it becomes dead; they want to flatter themeslves that
   they know the truth.
1. (p. 125) Social intelligence is the ability to see people in
   the most realistic light possible. Success attained without
   this intelligence is not true mastery, and will not last.
1. (p. 134) To become indignant at people's conduct is as foolish
   as to be angry with a stone because it rolls into your path.
   With many people the wisest thing you can do is to resolve to
   make use of those whom you cannot alter.
1. (p. 135) People who retain their childish attitudes will
   rarely be able to hold on to the success they may achieve
   through their talent.
1. (p. 137) The most effective attitude to adopt is one of
   supreme acceptance.
1. (p. 137) Some people have dark qualities that are especially
   pronounced. You cannot change such people at their core, but
   must merely avoid becoming their victim. You are an observer
   of the human comedy, and by being as tolerant as possible, you
   gain a much greater ability to understand people and to
   influence their behavior when necessary.
1. (p. 138) You need to train yourself to pay less attention to
   the words that people say and greater attention to their tone
   of voice, the look in their eye, their body language. These
   are all signals that might reveal a nervousness or excitement
   that is not expressed verbally. You will pick up cues from
   them that will register with you as feelings or sensations.
   Trust these sensations. Later, you can try to find a pattern
   to these signals and attempt to analyze what they mean.
1. (p. 143) People follow procedures without really knowing why,
   simply because these procedures may have worked in the past.
   These people become highly defensive if their ways are brought
   into question.
1. (p. 144) If you are doing work for a superior, be prepared for
   them to take full credit and leave your name our, but do *not*
   let this happen with colleagues.
1. (p. 145) The root cause of all passive aggressiveness is that
   human fear of direct confrontation.
1. (p. 159) Suffer fools gladly.
1. (p. 163) In the end, he came to welcome the attacks of his
   enemies for how much they had improved his work and toughened
   him up.
1. (p. 164) Avoid the madness of trying to change fools. It is
   all part of the human comedy, and it is nothing to get upset
   or lose sleep over. The height of wisdom is to actually
   exploit their foolishness -- using them for material for your
   work, as examples of things to avoid, or by looking for ways
   to turn their actions to your advantage.
1. (p. 181) You must let go of your need for comfort and
   security. Creative endeavors are by their nature uncertain.
1. (p. 185) Chance only favors the prepared mind.
1. (p. 231) Whenever your work begins to feel stale, you must
   return to the larger purpose and goal that impelled you in the
   first place.
1. (p. 245) Those who think in dualities -- believing that there
   is such a thing as "real" and "unreal", and that those are
   distinct entities that can never become blended into a third
   -- are creatively limited, and their work can quickly become
   dead and predictable. To maintain a dualistic approach to life
   requires that we repress many observable truths.
1. (p. 245) Contradictions contain a rich mine of information
   about a reality that is deeper and more complex than the one
   immediately perceived.
1. (p. 261) No moment is wasted if you pay attention and learn
   the lessons contained in every experience.
1. (p. 310) It is in fact the height of selfishness to merely
   consume what others create and to retreat into a shell of
   limited goals and immediate pleasures.
