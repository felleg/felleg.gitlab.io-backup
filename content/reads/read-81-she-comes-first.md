# Review

This is a weird book to review. It's about teaching men how to pleasure
a woman. This read is explicit!

There is in me this strong desire to inform by sharing what I really
read. At the same time, I feel like sharing what I learn about this
topic is like admitting I am clueless about it. Is posting this review a
heroic or an idiotic act? I guess there is only one way to find out.

In the star quotes below, I'll list only the quotes I'm comfortable
"writing out loud." If you want the juicy, explicit bits, you'll have to
find my handwritten notes above and endure my handwriting. :smile:

I'll end this review by saying that this book will not give you much
guidance on _creating_ intimacy. It assumes your partner and yourself
already have somewhat frequent sexual sessions and aims at deepening
those experiences. Thus, if your couple has desire disparity, I'd look
for another book before beginning _She Comes First_.

Let's hope I don't regret posting this...

# :star: Star quotes

- (p. 23) Separate the concept of procreation from pleasure.
- (p. 26) All of women's orgasms are clitoral.
- (p. 66) Fall asleep while holding her in your arms.
- (p. 86) Savor, don't suckle.
- (p. 88) Don't be threatened by what's in her imagination.
- (p. 207) Restraint (bondage) does not involve any pain or danger, but
   rather promotes trust and titillation.
- (p. 92) One of the most underestimated and underutilized forms of
   erotic stimulation, **a good solid foot massage** floods the
   bloodstream with endorphins and energizes the entire body.
- (p. 94) Don't be a show-off. The approach to style is by way of
   plainness, simplicity, orderliness, sincerity.
- (p. 98) If your attitude toward cunnilingus is "no pain, no gain",
   the sentiment is appreciated, but entirely unnecessary.
- (p. 111) Before starting and throughout the session, remind her of **the Three Assurances:**
    - Going down on her turns _you_ on, you enjoy it as much as she
      does.
    - There's no rush; she has all the time in the world. You want to
      savor every moment.
    - Her scent is provocative, her taste powerful: it all emanates from
      the same beautiful essence.
- (p. 176) Whether married or not, great sex often comes from the
   appreciation of repetition and the enjoyment of what you have.
- (p. 178) It's in the moments subsequent to orgasm when a man proves
   whether or not he's an "erotically civilized" adult. An extra 15
   minutes spent cuddling, snuggling and whispering sweet nothings is
   the path to greatness.
- (p. 184) Take a _pleasure_-oriented approach, not an
   _orgasm_-oriented one.
- (p. 185) [Routines](https://felx.cc/scf-routines)
