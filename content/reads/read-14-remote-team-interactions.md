# Review

This is a nice and *small* companion book to [Team Topologies](/reads/read-11-team-topologies/) with a focus on how to take advantage of the different topologies in a remote or hybrid work setting.

# :star: Star quotes

1. (p 1) Google's five keys to successful teams:
    1. **Psychological safety**: can teams take risks
       without feeling insecure?
    1. **Dependability**: Can teams count on one another?
    1. **Structure and clarity**: Clear goals, rules and
       execution plans
    1. **Meaning of work**: Is the work important to the
       team?
    1. **Impact of work**: Does the team believe their work
       matters?
1. (p. 5) Instead of spending time waiting on other teams to finish
   their work, focus on tracking then removing dependencies between
   teams.
1. (p. 6) Don't make it hard for people to discover meaning in written
   communications. Make messages self-contained to help reduce cognitive
   load.
1. (p. 34) Make it easy for people to self-serve, e.g. by having channel
   names that make it obvious where to get support (`#support-...`).
   Every time someone self-serves, someone's time is saved.
1. (p. 43) The problem with the organizational chart is that for a lot
   of knowledge work, we cannot have communication only happening up and
   down the different branches. Don't build communication channels
   around your org chart!
1. (p. 57) Use a net promoter score (NPS) to gauge how well the platform
   is perceived by internal customers.
