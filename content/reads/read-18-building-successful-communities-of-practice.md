1. (p. 9) Communities of practice give people opportunities to
   experiment with what they have learnt, in a safe environment and with
   the support of other people.
1. (p. 11) Silos can form where a group of people feel a deeper loyalty
   to each other than to other groups of people. Communication between
   silos can be very difficult, causing duplication of work and
   frustration for those inside them.
1. (p. 14) An organization that doesn't support the sharing of tacit
   knowledge will lose most of their knowledge as people move on.

   made people 12% more productive.
1. (p. 18) Through social learning, community members get better
   together and raise the skill level of everyone in the community. The
   community increases the happiness of its members by fostering
   positive relations with others and a feeling of acceptance.

   is inversely proportional to the community's energy level and
