A tiny book (around 80 pages), but filled with interesting facts about how communities of
practice are born and evolve. Easy recommendation!

# :star: Star quotes

1. (p. 9) Communities of practice give people opportunities to
   experiment with what they have learned, in a safe environment and with
   the support of other people.
1. (p. 11) Silos can form where a group of people feel a deeper loyalty
   to each other than to other groups of people. Communication between
   silos can be very difficult, causing duplication of work and
   frustration for those inside them.
1. (p. 14) An organization that doesn't support the sharing of tacit
   knowledge will lose most of their knowledge as people move on.
1. (p. 15) A study by Oswald, Proto and Sgroi showed that happiness
   made people 12% more productive.
1. (p. 18) Through social learning, community members get better
   together and raise the skill level of everyone in the community. The
   community increases the happiness of its members by fostering
   positive relations with others and a feeling of acceptance.
1. (p. 19) The input needed from leadership when building the community
   is inversely proportional to the community's energy level and
   visibility.
1. (p. 19) The 5 stages of a community of practice:
    1. Potential
    1. Forming
    1. Maturing
    1. Self-sustaining
    1. Transformation
1. (p. 22) Your community will have the best chance of building trust
   between its members if people have the chance to be physically in the
   same place and are able to meet face-to-face.
1. (p. 41) Even if attendance is low, carry on with the meeting. As
   others see benefits, they will join.
1. (p. 51) Make your social events inclusive and remember that different
   members have different needs and commitments to consider. For
   example, evening events will be fine for some people and not for
   others.
1. (p. 52) Types of learning activities:
    - Presentation and talks
    - Deliberate practice (mimicking experential learning in a safe
      environment)
    -  Games and workshops
    - Visits and tours to places within your organization or places that
      share similar challenges
1. (p. 53) Make sure you create time for the community to have less
   structured meetings where people can discuss things that are on their
   mind and being their problems to the community's safe space.
1. (p. 56) To ensure members continue to get value from the community,
   put aside regular time to review how the community is working
   together and how it could improve.
1. (p. 60) The 5-stage model of adult skill acquisition:
    1. **Novice**: follows the rules
    1. **Advanced beginner**: recognizes patterns
    1. **Competent**: chooses a perspective
    1. **Proficient**: responds to situations
    1. **Expert**: writes their own rules
1. (p. 60) Shu-ha-ri stages in martial arts:
    1. **Shu**: The protection stage, where the student follows what the
       master teaches them
    1. **Ha**: The breakaway stage, where the student starts to learn the
       underlying principles and theory behind a technique and begins to
       integrate learning into their practices
    1. **Ri**: The creating stage, where the student creates their own
       approaches and adapts what they have learned to their own
       particular circumstances
1. (p. 64) Types of members in a community of practice:
    - **Core**: without these members, there is no community
    - **Active**: people you expect to see regularly. They have potential to
      become core members.
    - **Occasional**: they show up from time to time. Spend time with these
      members to understand the barriers to becoming an active member.
    - **Peripheral**: they rarely come to community activities and are very
      passive. They may also be new joiners, or past members who opted
      out. Always leave room for them to become more active members in
      the future.
    - **Outside**: e.g. sponsors, supporters, members of other communities,
      etc. It might never be relevant for them to be anything more, but
      you should think about how to communicate with them.
