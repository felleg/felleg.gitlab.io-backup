# Review

Cultural diversity is a subject I am very passionate about. It is an
issue that seems to come up everywhere I look, not only in my
personal life, but also at work, and in the media. People in power feel
threatened by difference. People in out-groups want in and don't see a
reason why they should be left out. Why do we seem stuck in this eternal
struggle, and how can we all get along? How can we become more than the
sum of our parts?

When
I stumbled on *Cultural Diversity in Organizations* from author Taylor
Cox, Jr., Ph.D. at Renaissance for $3.25, it felt like providence. The
universe wanted me to read this book, it seems. I had all sorts of
expectations about what I would learn from this read. The author, who is
himself part of a minority group, was surely about to blow my mind.
However, being published over 30 years ago in 1993, the year I was born
(!), would this book stand the test of time?

Yes. Of course it did! Culture issues have been an ongoing struggle in
human organizations for thousands of years. A mere 30 years is not
enough to dampen the impact of Cox's deep reflections on how cultures
meld or repulse each other.

I should warn the reader that this is not a light read. The sentences
are often long and technical, so bring out your highlighter and take notes,
and make sure you are not in a hurry. I read from one of the reviews on
Amazon that a reader got this book for a masters class in Organizational
Behavior!

The book often revolves around the themes of racism, sexism, agism and
the like, but what I really admired is how the proposed solutions to
these problems also apply to *any* cultural differences. For example, a
portfolio company that bought 5 start-ups and needs to merge them
together might be merging 5 White-male dominated groups, and
yet the same in-group vs out-group dynamics would play out.
Despite all of our identity differences, we are all the same, and we are
all subject to these mysterious forces that put us into conflict.

There is a way out. One of my favorite quotes from the book came at the
very end: "A breakthrough for many organizations will be achieved by the
simple mechanism of bringing discussion about group differences out in
the open." So simple, yet so rare. Building a multicultural organization
is a balancing act that requires everyone to align on core values that
will push us towards integrating each other in the group. It's hard, but
it can be done. The reward is worth it.

I believe I've got everything I hoped for out of this book, and more. I
particularly enjoyed learning about the 5 stages of identity development
among Black people (see star quotes below, #32). This was eye-opening for
me.

In the heartfelt words of Toto Laraque who sings [Non au
racisme](https://open.spotify.com/track/2VPbJKmOqeaU84cvKuqDKt?si=sfHWOs4xRCSmhEYxJzAZMQ), "Nous sommes tous
pareil!" We are all the same.

Amen.

:star: Star quotes:

1. (p. 15) Behavior is driven by perceptions of reality. Therefore, what
   people believe about their opportunities in the work environment is
   of vital important regardless of whether or not these beliefs are
   consistent with the facts.
1. (p. 28) In their recruiting efforts, companies such as Merck, Xerox,
   Syntex, and Hoffman-LaRoche have been aggressively using publicity
   they have received as good places for women and/or racioethnic
   minorities to work. The recognition they have received is boosting
   recruiting efforts.
1. (p. 32) To adapt successfully to its external environment, a system
   must incorporate all the variety found in that environment.
1. (p. 32) Creativity thrives on diversity.
1. (p. 36) If organizations are successful in overcoming resistance to
   change in the especially difficult area of accepting diversity, they
   should be well positioned to deal with resistance to other types of
   organization change.
1. (p. 59) People are at their best when they can be themselves.
1. (p. 65) It has been shown that persons who are high producers in
   brainstorming tasks are more tolerant of ambiguity than low
   producers.
1. (p. 76) Sexual harassment exists when:
    - sexual activity is explicitly or implicitly made a condition for
      employment ("quid pro quo")
    - sexual conduct has the effect of interfering with a person's work
      performance or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work
      environment ("hostile environment")
1. (p. 79) Where harassment is ignored, it eventually worsens.
1. (p. 91) One of the challenges for organization and individual change
   in diverse organizations is to create the ability to acknowledge
   differences in positive or neutral terms.
1. (p. 93) Stereotyping occurs as an overreaction to behaviors that do
   not match our expectations.
1. (p. 116) If the norm to compete is strong, people will often engage
   in competitive behavior even when the structure of the task makes it
   irrational to do so.
1. (p. 118) **Locus of control (LOC)** refers to beliefs about the
   causation of life events. Persons with an *external LOC* believe that
   the primary determinants of life events are external, often
   uncontrollable forces, whereas persons with an *internal LOC* tend to
   believe that they themselves are the primary cause of events in their
   lives.
1. (p. 119) It seems logical that members of racioethnic minority groups
   (and other low-power groups) may have a more *external LOC* than
   majority group members because they are much more sensitive to the
   influence of racioethnicity on life events.
1. (p. 124) A classic asymmetry in communication between women and men
   is that women often communicate problems in an effort to obtain
   support and a sharing of ideas, while men often interpret the mention
   of a problem as a request for them to solve it.
1. (p. 126) Members of minority groups are more likely to feel that they
   must think ideas through fully and be sure before they speak. This
   hinders psychological safety.
1. (p. 143) Majority group members often see incidents of racioethnic
   injustice as "isolated occurrences" while many minorities see them as
   single events in an overall pattern of oppression that is embedded in
   the social system itself.
1. (p. 146) Majority members are less favorable toward minorities when
   their numbers are relatively large. Majority members perceive
   minority members as a serious threat to their established power.
1. (p. 161) **Organization culture** is defined as the underlying
   values, beliefs and principles that serve as a foundation for the
   organization's management system, as well as the set of management
   practices and behaviors that both exemplify and reinforce those
   principles.
1. (p. 162) **Culture strength** is a combination of the extent to which
   norms and values are clearly defined and the extent to which they are
   rigorously enforced. A strong culture is one in which everyone
   construes a situation similarly; thus the situation induces uniform
   expectancies and a uniform response.
1. (p. 163) When organizational culture is weak, people invoke their own
   identities for modes of behaving. The extreme of weak culture is
   organizational chaos.
1. (p. 163) Organizations can be described and compared on the four
   dimensions of:
    - predictability -- spontaneity
    - internal focus -- external focus
    - order -- flexibility
    - long-term focus -- short-term focus
1. (p. 165) :star: Intimidate knowledge about getting along in an organization (the
   unspoken, unwritten and sometimes most critical information) is
   transmitted in ongoing small-scale socialization, particularly when
   the newcomer:
    - acquires organizationally appropriate attitudes and behaviors
    - resolves intra- and interorganizational conflicts
    - begins to individualize their organizational role transmitted
1. (p. 165) Acculturation refers to the process for resolving cultural
   differences and of cultural change and adaptation between groups,
   especially when one group is being merged into a larger, more
   dominant group.
1. (p. 166) **Pluralism** refers to a two-way learning and adaptation
   process in which both the organization and entering members from
   various cultural backgrounds change to some degree to reflect the
   cultural norms and values of the other(s).
1. (p. 166) Pluralism emphasizes interdependence and mutual appreciation
   among cultures and the importance of preservation of microculture
   group identity. It is an acculturation process in which the entering
   members assimilate a limited number of core behaviors and values
   while preserving important differences along other dimensions.
1. (p. 168) An organizationsl culture with a high tolerance for
   ambiguity will exert less pressure for convergence and will tolerate
   more divergence. Thus these organizations might be more inclined to
   favor pluralism as an acculturation mode.
1. (p. 168) In organizations with high tolerance for ambiguity,
   sociocultural conflicts would be viewed as normal and potentially
   useful rather than as dysfunctional and to be avoided.
1. (p. 176) In transitional assimilationist-oriented organizations,
   **cultural distance** will be inversely related to positive member
   career outcomes.
1. (p. 178) When a group has held a dominant position in a social system
   over a long period of time, members of the group experience
   psychological discomfort when the percentage of minority group
   members exceeds about 20%.
1. (p. 193) For minorities in predominantly majority settings, the time
   and energy that is used to establish legitimacy could be more
   productively used to solve organizational problems.
1. (p. 51) Identity development among Black people has five stages:
    1. **Preencounter**: Black people reject Black heritage and define
       themselves in terms of White culture
    1. **Encounter**: Black people seek identification with Black culture
    1. **Immersion/emersion**: Black people have complete identification with
       Black culture and hostility toward Whites
    1. **Internalization**: Black people become comfortable with Black
       identity; anger leaves and racism is transcended
    1. **Internationalization/commitment**: Black people become behaviorally
       active in fighting racism.
1. (p. 213) On a practical level, **standardization** in the bureaucratic
   sense often translates into an inflexible system that responds
   unfavorably to anything beyond the ordinary. It is rooted in the
   bureaucratic principles of:
    - division of labor
    - impersonality
    - separation of job and jobholder
    - emphasis on written rules and regulation
1. (p. 229) :star: An organization which simply contains many different culture
   groups is a **plural organization**. An organization is
   **multicultural** only if it values this diversity.
1. (p. 237) Most experts agree that education is a crucial first step;
   however, it is important to recognize that it has limitations as an
   organization change tool and should not be used in isolation. It is
   also important to approach training as an ongoing education process
   rather than a one-shot seminar.
1. (p. 241) To measure the impact of diversity and its management in
   organization, apply a stage model to evaluation:
    - **Stage 1**: Affective outcomes of individuals should be
      evaluated:
        - career satisfaction
        - job involvement
        - organizational commitment
        - attitude changes
    - **Stage 2**: Individual achievement measures should be measured:
        - intergroup differences in performance ratings
        - promotion rates
        - compensation
    - **Stage 3**: Organizational performance indicators should be
      addressed:
        - work quality
        - turnover
        - productivity
        - absenteeism
    - **Stage 4**: Market share and profitability should be examined as
      long-term measures of effectiveness.
1. (p. 243) [Tools for organizational
   transformation](https://felx.cc/tot)
1. (p. 249) View affirmative action as a method to address the
   disadvantages that members of out-groups have due to a combination of
   ethnocentrism and unequal power distribution. It compensates for the
   existing discrimination.
1. (p. 250) **Affirmative action** in practice fundamentally means the
   explicit use of a person's group identity as a criterion in making
   selection decisions. Candidates of underrepresented groups are
   selected in preference to those from overrepresented groups.
1. (p. 251) :star: Redefine the concept of equal opportunity to consider the
   total life history of a person as relevant in defining opportunity,
   rather than just the moment at hand.
1. (p. 252) Affirmative action has a downside for both majority and
   minority group members:
    - Majority group members have to sacrifice some opportunities due to
      the current imbalance of opportunity
    - Members of minority groups must overcome the assumption by many
      that they were selected only because of their identity and not
      because of their talent.
1. (p. 258) Experts on conflict management have noted that a certain
   amount of interpersonal conflict is inevitable and perhaps even
   healthy in organizations. However, conflict becomes destructive when
   it is excessive, not well managed, or rooted in struggles for power
   rather than the differentiation of ideas.
1. (p. 260) :star: A breakthrough for many organizations will be achieved by
   the simple mechanism of bringing discussion about group differences
   out in the open.
