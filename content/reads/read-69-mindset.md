*Mindset* is a modern classic when it comes to self-help books. Its core
idea is simple: our way of thinking is a mixture of two basic mindsets:
the **fixed** mindset and the **growth** mindset. Obviously, the
**growth** mindset is the one we want, since growing allows us to reach
new heights.

The book's is essentially a tour around all the aspects around the
dichotomy between the fixed and growth mindsets, starting with its
discovery by the author and collaborators. It then proceeds to show us
the consequences of each mindsets in different spheres of life, such as
parenting, business, school, relationships and sports, as the cover
suggests. Finally, it lays down a "recipe" for building a growth mindset
in ourselves or our prot√©g√©s (e.g. children) that involves seeking
opportunities for learning and how to enact a plan.

I felt like the author was often repeating herself when it came to
explaining the effect of mindset in each area of human life. Once you
get the idea that growth mindset is the key, it was often tempting for
me to skip a few paragraphs, thinking "yes, yes, of course, people with
the growth mindset reap all the rewards." There is no denying however
how truly deep the impacts of mindset can be. I feel like I have gone
through a transformation of mindset myself and captured it when I wrote my [Overcoming
Learning Anxiety](/posts/2022/08/overcoming-learning-anxiety/) post. If
you find yourself stuck in a fixed mindset, working towards building
your growth mindset might be the most crucial step towards significantly
improving your enjoyment of life. Believe me, it's worth it!

One notion buried at the end of the book that I found particularly
interesting is the "false growth mindset." Apparently, after the first
edition of this book was published, a misunderstanding of the core
concept began spreading, and people eager to build the growth mindset in
their children starting praising effort over progress. For example, if a
child fails a test after studying very hard, some parents would give
praise for studying hard, without acknowledging the failure. There is a
fine line here: what we should do is recognize the effort, acknowledge
the failure, and help the student recognize that despite failing, their
effort allowed them to make significant progress.

In summary, I think the core concept of Mindset is useful to understand
why some people settle for mediocrity and why some people demonstrate
grit despite difficult circumstances. Check it out!

   we can of course appreciate their effort, but we should never be

      resume learning.
1. (p. 217) We as educators must take seriously our responsibility to
   create growth-mindset-friendly environments, where people:

    - know that we are totally dedicated to collaborating with them on
      their learning

   your "self" for many years and that has given you your route to
   self-esteem.
1. (p. 242) Many people with the fixed mindset understand that their
   cloak of specialness was really a suit of armor they built to feel
   safe, strong, and worthy. While it may have protected them early on,
   later it constricted their growth, sent them into self-defeating
   battles, and cut them off from satisfying, mutual relationships.
1. (p. 248) Learn to separate your needs and desires from your children.
   For example, you may have "needed" a daughter who was number one in
   everything, but your daughter needed something else: acceptance from
   your parents and freedom yo grow.
1. (p. 254) When people change to a growth mindset, they change from a
   judge-and-be-judged framework to a learn-and-help-learn framework.
1. (p. 262) Daily questions:
    - What are the opportunities for learning and growth today?
        - For myself?
        - For the people around me?
    - As you think of opportunities, form a plan. "When, where and how
      will I embark on my plan?"
    - As you encounter the inevitable obstacles and setbacks, form a new
      plan. "When, where and how will I act on my *new* plan?"
    - When you succeed, ask yourself: "What do I have to do to maintain
      and continue the growth?"
