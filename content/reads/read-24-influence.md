# Review

A bit too long-winded for its own good, *Influence* still contains
powerful insight about what influences our decisions. (Thanks Dan for
this recommendation!)

Here's a summary of the methods of influence discussed in the book:

- Reciprocation
  - Enforces ininvited debts
  - Can trigger unfair exchanges
- Commitment and consistency
- Social proof
- Liking
  - Physical attractiveness
  - Similarity
  - Compliments
  - Contact and cooperation
- Authority
  - Clothes
  - Trappings

# :star: Star quotes

1. (p. 252) Individuals holding a weak or unpopular position can get us
   to agree with that position by arranging to have their message
   restricted. The most effective strategy may not be to publicize their
   unpopular views, but to get those views officially censored and then
   publicize the censorship.
