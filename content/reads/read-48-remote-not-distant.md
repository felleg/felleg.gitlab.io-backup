# Review

The 2020 pandemic has shaken the business world like seemingly never
before. It seems evident to me that we are currently observing a massive
shift from an office-first mentality to a more and more hybrid and
remote-first reality. This new world feels alien to most leaders.

This book offers many suggestions on how to conduct a remote-first
company without having to compromise on building a strong company
culture. Indeed, as I am now deeply convinced, culture is of the utmost
importance when running a company and should be designed as intently as
a flagship product.

The book gave me a reality check with these two quotes: "The office is
the new offsite" (p. 43) and "The people who are more supportive of
fully returning to the physical office are those who were successful in
that environment" (p. 196). That was a hard pill to swallow for me, as a
firm believer of the potential an office provides for building culture.

The truth is, what works for me might not work for others. If I'm part
of a minority of people who can reach their peak productivity at the
office, I have to accept it and be willing to better understand what
allows my peers to be productive from home. This is a big shift for
leaders because it forces them to choose between the old habits that
gave them their current success, and embracing a new uncomfortable
reality that in theory will get them to the next level. Which one would
you choose? As the author brilliantly puts it, "Are you open to
maximizing the benefits of a remote environment even if it means your
role feels less important?"

If you're interested in new ideas for leadership, you'll find plenty in
this book. The six work modes for distributed teams (p. 201), the pros
and cons of synchronous vs asynchronous communication (p. 212) and the
seven decision-making methods (p. 269) in particular seem to have a lot
of potential for impact.

In summary, if you're leading a remotely distributed team, you'll
probably find it useful to compare your current strategies with what
other players of the industry are doing. If you're leading an
office-first team, this book will give you a glimpse of the inescapable
future we all seem to be headed towards.

# :star: Star quotes

1. (p. 39) When fearful CEOs talk about workplace culture, they're
   really talking about workplace control.
1. (p. 43) "Are you open to maximizing the benefits of a remote
   environment even if it means your role feels less important, for
   example by letting team members co-create the new culture rather than
   dictating the terms yourself?"
1. (p. 43) The office is the new offsite.
1. (p. 44) The new office should include:
    - The library, a quiet space for deep work and research
    - The plaza, a kitchen and lunchroom to socialize with colleagues
    - The avenue, a transitional space for passing with the potential
      for casual collaboration
1. (p. 69) A crisis is a spotlight. It's a moment to demonstrate your
   values and lead by example.

   under a carpet becomes the things you implicitly endorse.

1. (p. 105) Feeling rejected by our social system feels a lot like
