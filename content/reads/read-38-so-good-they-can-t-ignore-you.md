# Review

This is the fastest book I have ever read! I really enjoyed it: short,
to the point, and with lovely ideas that feel great to think about. To
me it confirmed that I am currently on the right path to become "so good
they can't ignore me." I have identified my mission ("build a learning
organization to tap into the human potential") and I feel like I am
building my career capital by learning how to learn. Overall, this book
felt like a nice pat on the back, and I think like it can be inspiring
for someone who might be as lost as I was when I started my career.
(Thanks Ricardo for this recommendation!)
