Here's a book I desperately needed to read. For some time, I had been
noticing a pattern in my conversations. I wasn‚Äôt getting the desired
outcomes. I often felt like either I was pushing too hard, or couldn't
find the right words to accurately say what I meant. This was happening
both at work and in my personal life. My emotions were often getting the
best of me.

And from reading this book, I'm now convinced that I am far from the
only one! :sweat_smile:

What the authors of Crucial Conversations (CCs) give us is a framework to
think
differently about the conversations that contain the key moments that
shape our lives. Landing a job (or losing it), getting married (or
divorced), and so many more of the transitions that define us are
often dictated by how we handle the conversations that precede them.
However, not all conversations are crucial: CCs can be recognized when these three elements are present simultaneously in a conversation.

- High Stakes
- Strong Emotions
- Opposing Opinions

What really blew my mind in the book is the notion of the **Path to
Action** (PTA). Summarized in my own words:

1. See & hear (facts)
1. Tell a story to yourself (guess)
1. React to the story (feel)
1. Act on your feelings (silence, violence, ...)

Between my reading sessions, I started noticing how everything I say and
do is driven by the PTA. I started noticing that when I was feeling
angry or hurt or stressed, it was *always* as a result of a mental story
I was telling myself. They were never complicated stories; as the
authors rightfully explain, our mental storytelling happens in a flash.
"I am a failure" is a prime example of that. The "Aha!" moment came
when I realized that, indeed, any story is driven by the facts I have
access to. If facts are random dots on a page, the story our brain
constructs is a "best guess" at the line that strings all these dots
together.

By remembering that this story is a guess, we can get used to rethinking
our stories by interpreting the facts differently. We can steer what
kind of story we want to tell ourselves and, as a result, have a real
impact on the emotions that story will make us feel. Our emotions play a
huge part in influencing what we say and do at a potentially crucial
moment. By telling different stories, we can break the loop of the
downward spiral.

The book packs a lot more acronyms and examples. You'll learn about
The Fool's Choice, AMPP skills, WWWF commitments, the CURE tool, STATE-ing your PTA, VVH
stories... There's a lot of theory behind the
CCs framework. Luckily, I found that you can cover a
lot of ground without having to remember what all of those mental tools
stand for. You can easily get 80% of your desired results with 20% of
the theory.

Just remember that handling CCs well is like learning how to ride a
bike: you can only get good by trying, and trying again. Overall, I'm
excited to see where the CC framework will lead my conversational
outcomes and I am looking forward to testing it with my friends,
colleagues and loved ones.

**Top 10 quotes** that stuck out to me:

1. (p. 5) You can measure the health of relationships, teams, and
   organizations by measuring the lag time between when problems are
   identified & when they are resolved.
1. (p. 26) When people purposely withhold meaning from one another,
   individually smart people can do collectively stupid things.
1. (p. 48) The more words it takes you to describe the topic, the less
   prepared you are to talk.
1. (p. 65) Ask yourself, "What am I acting like I want?" to take a look
   at your behavior and work backwards to the motive.
1. (p. 97) When we don't admit to our own mistakes, we obsess about
   others' faults, our innocence and our powerlessness to do anything
   other than what we're already doing.
1. (p. 139) Forgive those who sin differently than yourself.
1. (p. 173) We express confidence by sharing our facts and stories
   clearly. We demonstrate our humility by then asking others to share
   their views (and meaning it!)
1. (p. 177) The only limit to how strongly you can express your opinion
   is your willingness to be equally vigorous in encouraging others to
   challenge it.
1. (p. 219) If you live by the compliment, you'll die by the criticism.
1. (p. 238) While a conversation doesn't necessarily need to end with a
   decision, it should always end with a commitment: Who does what by
   when? How will you follow up?
