# :star: Star quotes:

1. (p. 4) Team members collaborate more easily and naturally if they
   perceive themselves as being alike.
1. (p. 5) The greater the proportion of experts a team has, the more
   likely it is to disintegrate into non-productive conflict or
   stalemate.
1. (p. 6) A team's success or failure at collaborating reflects the
   philosophy of top executives in the organization.
1. (p. 8) The perceived behavior of senior executives plays a
   significant role in determining how cooperative teams are prepared to
   be.
1. (p. 10) :star: Having first-name acquaintance with people across the
   company brings a sense of dynamism to interactions.
1. (p. 11) Two HR programs that improve team performance:
    - Training in skills relative to collaborative behavior
    - Support for informal community building
1. (p. 17) To transfer skills across business functions or units, move
   entire small teams intact instead of reshuffling individuals into new
   positions. The group formed would be composed of small pods of
   colleagues from each area. This ensures that key heritage
   relationships continue to strengthen over time.
1. (p. 17) **Heritage relationships** in a team initially increase the
   chance of success, but there is a caveat. When a significant number
   of people within the team know one another, they tend to form strong
   subgroups, which increases the probability of conflict among fault
   lines.
1. (p. 18) Collaboration improves when the roles of individual team
   members are clearly defined and well understood. Individuals feel
   that they can do a significant portion of their work independently.
1. (p. 23) The higher the proportion of people who don't know anyone
   else on the team and the greater the diversity, the less likely the
   team members are to share knowledge.
1. (p. 36) :star: **"Ask why five times"**: Saying B causes A is
   simplistic. The chain of thought required to discover that C --> B
   and D --> C quickly takes you into a new domain, probably someone
   else's. Rather than concoct complex solutions within their own
   domains, engineers must seed simple ones beyond them.
1. (p. 36) :star: Doing the 5 whys is not about depth at all -- it's
   about breadth.
1. (p. 41) Monetary carrots and accountability sticks motivate people to
   perform narrow, specified tasks but generally discourage people from
   going beyond them. **Admiration and applause** are far more effective
   stimulants of above-and-beyond behavior.
1. (p. 43) **Factors that drive up trust**:
    - With their reputations at stake, people are less likely to act
      opportunistically
    - With the same information available to everyone, there is less
      chance that one party will exploit another's ignorance.
    - With a common vocabulary and way of working, fewer
      misunderstandings occur.
1. (p. 43) Where trust is the currency, reputation is the source of
   power.
1. (p. 43) :star: There is more power in being an information source
   than an information sink.
1. (p. 44)
    - **The classical sources of transaction costs**:
        - mutual vulnerability in the face of uncertainty
        - conflicting interests
        - unequal access to information
    - --> Low transaction costs buy more innovation than do high
      monetary incentives.
1. (p. 46) Organizations that are able to substitute trust for contracts
   gain more from the collaboration than they lose in bargaining power.
1. (p. 47) :star: Let everybody see everybody's real work. Let people
   learn to filter and sort for themselves. Don't abstract, summarize or
   channel. Fodder is good.
1. (p. 49) :star: The network is the innovator. Take averagely talented
   people and make them work as spectacular teams.
1. (p. 53) :star: You can't improve collaboration until you've addressed
   the issue of conflict.
1. (p. 55) Conflict management works best when the parties involved in a
   disagreement are equipped to manage it themselves.
1. (p. 65) To prevent conflict deadlock, don't simply kick the issue up
   to your manager. Present the disagreement jointly to the boss(es).
   This will guarantee that the ultimate decision maker has access to a
   wide array of perspectives on the conflict, its causes, and the
   various ways it might be resolved.
1. (p. 67) :star: In a complex organization where many issues have
   significant implications for numerous parts of the business,
   unilateral responses to unilateral escalations are a recipe for
   inefficiency, bad decisions, and ill feelings.
1. (p. 69) Clear communication about the resolution of the conflict can
   increase people's willingness and ability to implement decisions.
   Failing to take the time to explain how a decision was reached and
   the factors that went into it squanders a major opportunity.
1. (p. 74) People who need to collaborate more effectively usually _don't_
   need to align around and work toward a common goal. They need to
   quickly and creatively solve problems by managing the inevitable
   conflict so that it works in their favor.
1. (p. 75) :star: Even the most carefully constructed incentives won't
   eliminate tensions between people with competing business objectives.
   Ironically, focusing on incentives as a means to encourage
   collaboration can end up undermining it.
1. (p. 108) :star: A history of independence often leads to
   protectionist behavior.
1. (p. 111) Treat your workers the way you want them to treat your
   customers.
1. (p. 112) The softer cooperation-promoting measures can't take hold if
   the harder ones (power structures, metrics, incentives) don't
   reinforce them.
1. (p. 117) Companies must develop attractive career paths that give
   emerging generalist stars a sense of identity and a clear route for
   advancement.
1. (p. 133) Try to eliminate the peer group meetings that are held just
   for the purpose of saying "We had a peer group meeting."
1. (p. 143) Knowledge-sharing activities should focus on business
   results rather than social events.
1. (p. 143) Achieving results together creates a track record showing
   that people are really helping one another.
1. (p. 143) :star: Trust is a byproduct of effective collaboration.
1. (p. 144) :star: **Human portals** are people who can use their
   extensive knowledge about who knows what and their understanding of
   what actually is needed to creatively make connections between
   information seekers and information holders. They can save senior
   executives the struggle of maintaining relationships created from
   overnetworking.
1. (p. 149) Meetings are a problem when we use them to agree to disagree
   and schedule another meeting.
1. (p. 153) One of the rarest managerial skills is the ability to
   understand which tools will work in a given situation and which will
   misfire.
1. (p. 154) The primary task of management is to get people to work
   together in a systematic way.
1. (p. 158) [Elements of the four types of cooperation
   tools](https://felx.cc/coop-tools):
    - Power
    - Management
    - Leadership
    - Culture
1. (p. 161) :star: A wise manager in a low-consensus environment would
   *not* agree to lead a change program without the authority to wield
   the right power tools
1. (p. 164) :star: **Culture** is a pattern of shared basic assumptions
   that was learned by a group as it solved its problems of external
   adaptation and internal integration, that has worked well enough to
   be considered valid and, therefore, to be taught to new members as
   the correct way to perceive, think, and feel in relation to those
   problems.
1. (p. 164) Companies with strong cultures in many ways can be
   self-managing. This very strength can make such organizations highly
   resistant to change.
1. (p. 165) As the company succeeds, employees who fit with the ways of
   working, and who want what senior management wants, tend to be
   promoted.
1. (p. 165) **Success** is the mechanism that builds consensus around
   what people want and how they can get it.
1. (p. 177) :star: Creating a **virtuous spiral of trust, group identity,
   and group efficacy** requires a team atmosphere in which **the norms**
   build the ability to respond constructively in emotionally
   uncomfortable situations and influence emotions in constructive ways.
1. (p. 177) **Personal competence** comes from being aware of and
   regulating one's own emotions.
1. (p. 177) **Social competence** is awareness and regulation of others'
   emotions.
1. (p. 179) :star: Picking up on defensiveness is necessary if the team wants
   to make understand its desire to amplify good work, *not* negate it.
1. (p. 179) :star: A more emotionally intelligent group would pause
   first to hear out an objection instead of moving to a majority vote
   in the interest of expedience. Or, it would ask, "Are there any
   perspectives we haven't heard yet or thought through completely?"
   even if there appeared to be consensus.
1. (p. 181) Inevitably, a team member will indulge in behavior that
   crosses the line, and the team *must* feel comfortable calling the
   foul.
1. (p. 181) Done right, confrontation can be seen in a positive light;
   it's a way for the group to say, "We want you in -- we need your
   contribution." Without confrontation, disruptive behavior can fester
   and erode a sense of trust in a team.
1. (p. 182) When an individual is upset, it make make all the difference
   to have the group members acknowledge that person's feelings.
    - For example, in a meeting, a team member arrived angry because the
      time and place were inconvenient. Another member announced the
      sacrifice the man had made to be there and thanked him. The man's
      attitude turned around 180 degrees.
1. (p. 183) Some teams suffer because they aren't aware of emotions at
   the group level.
1. (p. 185) Consciously resist the temptation to join the complaining
   and blaming and instead try to reverse the cycle with a positive,
   constructive note.
1. (p. 186) A team in control of its own emotions refuses to feel
   powerless and is eager to take charge.
1. (p. 190) Great design is best accomplished through the creative
   function of diverse teams and not the solitary pursuit of brilliant
   individuals.
1. (p. 193) Novelty ideas to create interpersonal understanding:
    - having a meeting without a table
    - conducting an inventory of team members' various learning styles
1. (p. 196)
    - Group emotional intelligence leads to:
        - Trust, identity, efficacy, which leads to:
            - Participation, cooperation, collaboration, which leads to:
                - Better decisions, more creative solutions, and higher
                  productivity.
1. (p. 196) **Group emotional intelligence** is *not* about a team
   member working all night to meet a deadline; it *is* about saying
   thank you for doing so. It is *not* about in-depth discussion of
   ideas; it *is* about asking a quiet member for their thoughts.
1. (p. 197) :star: Assume that undesirable behavior takes place for a
   reason. Find out what the reason is. Ask questions and listen. Avoid
   negative attributions.
1. (p. 199) :star: :star: When harmony is false, tension is unexpressed and
   builds up.
