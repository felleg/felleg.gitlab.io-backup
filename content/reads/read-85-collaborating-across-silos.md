# :star: Star quotes:

1. (p. 4) Team members collaborate more easily and naturally if they
   perceive themselves as being alike.
1. (p. 5) The greater the proportion of experts a team has, the more
   likely it is to disintegrate into non-productive conflict or
   stalemate.
1. (p. 6) A team's success or failure at collaborating reflects the
   philosophy of top executives in the organization.
1. (p. 8) The perceived behavior of senior executives plays a
   significant role in determining how cooperative teams are prepared to
   be.
1. (p. 10) :star: Having first-name acquaintance with people across the
   company brings a sense of dynamism to interactions.
1. (p. 11) Two HR programs that improve team performance:
    - Training in skills relative to collaborative behavior
    - Support for informal community building
1. (p. 17) To transfer skills across business functions or units, move
   entire small teams intact instead of reshuffling individuals into new
   positions. The group formed would be composed of small pods of
   colleagues from each area. This ensures that key heritage
   relationships continue to strengthen over time.
