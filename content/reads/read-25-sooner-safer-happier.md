# Review

Mind-blowing. Incredible. Reading this felt exactly like reading *The
DevOps Handbook* for the first time. What I love about BVSSH is that
there are no buzzwords to get confused about: this is simply solid
advice that every organization should follow.

   or improvement. How may I help you, dear team member?"
