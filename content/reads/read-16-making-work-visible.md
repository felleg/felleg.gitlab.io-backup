# :star: Star quotes
1. (p. 1) The five thieves of time:
    - Too much work in progress (WIP)
    - Unknown dependencies (something you didn't know needs to happen
      before you finish)
    - Unplanned work (interruptions at the worst moment)
    - Conflicting priorities (tasks that compete with each other)
    - Neglected work (partially completed work)
1. (p. 9) It can take up to 20 minutes to get back to a previous
   thinking spot after an interruption.
1. (p. 10) The WIP limit is what allows you to say "No, there is no
   capacity to take on more work right now."
1. (p. 10) Reducing WIP is liberating (not limiting!) The right amount
   of WIP allows us to maintain a healthy amount of work.
1. (p. 90) It doesn't matter how big or small something is when you can
   only truly focus on one thing at a time.
1. (p. 102) The tasks in the backlog are options, they may never get
   done. But once work passes the line of commitment (i.e. the ticket is
   moved to the board), that explicitly signals it has been prioritized
   and is moving forward. By that logic, items in the board should never
   go back to the backlog.
1. (p. 109) To make neglected work obvious, flag work items that haven't
   moved or been updated within a certain number of days.
1. (p. 134) The more WIP there is in the pipeline, the longer things
   take.
1. (p. 144) Generate a Time Thief 'O Gram by tagging your tickets if
   they have one of these thieves:
    - unplanned work
    - unknown dependencies
    - conflicting priorities
    - neglected work
