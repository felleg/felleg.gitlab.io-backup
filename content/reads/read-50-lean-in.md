# Review

You know what? I'm feeling impostor syndrome as I attempt to write this
review. It's ironic, because *Lean In* is a book that changed the lives
of many people as it discussed, among many things, the impostor syndrome
of women who work outside of traditional roles. Here I am, a white
man, about to pose a judgement on these ideas. I feel completely out of
my depth. Part of me feels like I shouldn't be allowed to say much more
than, "This book is good, we should all read it." Gender issues, man...

And yet. This is how many women and many people feel like every hour of
the day. I'm feeling it now. It almost physically hurts. It's only been
30 minutes and I already wish I could make this feeling disappear. How
can some people tolerate this inner pain? I believe life isn't meant to
feel this way. To adapt a quote from the author, "I should seek out
larger, possibly less sympathetic audiences. I should take my own advice
and be ambitious. Writing this [review] is not just me encouraging
others to lean in. This is me leaning in. Writing this [review] is what
I would do if I weren't afraid." This gives me the courage to go ahead.
If you have any feedback about what I say here, I'll see you in the
comments. :smile:

With that said, on with the book. As I was reading, I couldn't help
thinking of my partner, who is a woman with what I consider to be
unmistakeable impostor syndrome (though she would say that's not her
feeling like an impostor, that's her being "realistic"). While we have a
strong feminist movement in our Western culture, there is still so much
we (all genders) need to learn about how to make room for women in our
organizations, even 10 years after *Lean In* was published. Like, what
does "making room" even mean? It's a vast subject. To me, the simple
fact that having ambition is seen as a positive in men but a negative in
women tells the whole story. This is what we have to train our minds on.
We must reframe ambition as a positive for all.

I find that my mind most frequently reframes its deeply held ideas
through stories, and I'm happy to say that this book has plenty. The
author generously shares from her personal experiences, from her start
as a "bossy smart girl" (and how that affected her relationships) to her
unique perspective as one of the (tech) world's most powerful women, as
COO of Facebook. And she's a mother, too! She has seen it all and she
will make you feel seen.

I'll finish by saying that this is not a book for women only. Many men
would benefit from reading it as well. There are many questions we wish
could ask women but wouldn't dare. *Lean In* has some of the answers
many men are looking for, like how a senior man can mentor a younger
woman without it looking like flirting.

"Equality between partners leads to happier relationships", as Sheryl
says. And in tomorrow's workplace, relationships are everything. With
that said, I recommend you give *Lean In* a chance.
