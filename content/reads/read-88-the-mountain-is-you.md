# :star: Star Quotes

1. (p. 8) You must mourn the loss of your younger self, the person who
   has gotten you this far but who is no longer equipped to carry you
   onward.
1. (p. 11) **Self-sabotage** is simply the presence of an unconscious
   need that is being fulfilled by the self-sabotaging behavior. It is
   a coping mechanism that comes from irrational fear.
1. (p. 17) Criticism comes with creating anything for the public and
   isn't a reason to *not* do it.
1. (p. 18) Even though we think we're after happiness, we're actually
   trying to find whatever we're most used to.
1. (p. 21) The first step in healing anything is taking full
   accountability.
1. (p. 21) The greatest act of self-love is to no longer accept a life
   you are unhappy with.
1. (p. 28) Overcoming self-sabotage is not about trying to figure out
   how to override your impulses; it is first determining why those
   impulses exist in the first place.
1. (p. 28) Self-sabotage is not a way we hurt ourselves; it's a way we
   try to protect ourselves.
1. (p. 31) Playing small allows you to evade scrutiny.
1. (p. 34) We are not really wired to be happy; we are wired to be
   comfortable.
1. (p. 34) In **uprooting**, you are jumping from relationship to
   relationship instead of confronting relationship issues when they
   arise. You are not allowing yourself to blossom; you are only
   comfortable with the process of sprouting.
1. (p. 37) Don't worry about writing a bestseller, just write.
1. (p. 37) Instead of having something done perfectly, focus on just
   getting it done.
1. (p. 37) If you don't get started, you'll never arrive.
1. (p. 43) When you find yourself struggling with something, you have
   to ask yourself: "Do I actually want to do this?"
1. (p. 45) :star: If you learn to love others, you will learn to love
   yourself.
1. (p. 48) :star: Don't see your success as a differentiator. That
   will always make you feel bad and uncomfortable. Instead, see
   success as a tool that can do important and positive things in the
   world and your own life.
1. (p. 50) The idea of having "made it" makes us afraid that we are
   reaching the pinnacle and therefore will fall off if it.
1. (p. 53, 54) People who are constantly "busy" are running from
   themselves. Nobody is "busy" unless they want to be busy. Being
   "busy" is not a virtue; it only signals to others that you do not
   know how to manage your time or your tasks.
1. (p. 56) You should leave a get-together feeling energized and
   inspired, not exhausted and angry.
1. (p. 63)
    - :star: If your subconscious core commitment is to be **in control**, your core need is **trust**.
    - If your subconscious core commitment is to be **needed**, your core need is **wanted**.
    - :star: If your subconscious core commitment is to be **loved by others**, your core need is **self-love**.
1. (p. 64) :star: The only issue that has ever really existed in your
   life is living out of alignment with your core needs and,
   therefore, your core purpose.
1. (p. 68) Your emotions are not always an accurate reflection of
   reality, but they are always valid and need to be validated.
1. (p. 74) Sadness is the normal and correct response to the loss of
   something you very much love.
1. (p. 74) :star: Sadness does not release itself all at once. It
   happens in waves, sometimes unexpectedly.
1. (p. 74) :star: Crying at appropriate times is one of the biggest
   signs of mental strength, as people who are struggling often find
   it difficult to release their feelings and be vulnerable.
1. (p. 77) Other people are under no obligation to live up to our
   ideas of them.
1. (p. 77) We imagine that if we are worried, anxious or angry about a
   potential threat, it will remain within our awareness and therefore
   cannot surprise us. This is derailing our lives *right now*,
   because we are channeling our energy into something that is outside
   of our control.
1. (p. 81) **An incomplete list of valid needs**:
    - To feel validated
    - To feel the presence of another person
    - To feel wanted
    - To feel secure
1. (p. 82) Often, the first reason we start neglecting our essential
   needs is because we think we are weak for having them.
1. (p. 84) No outward accomplishment is going to give you a true and
   lasting sense if inner peace.
1. (p. 86) The happier you are with something, the less you need other
   people to be.
1. (p. 93) :star: Your feelings, while valid, are not always accurate
   reflections of reality. They are accurate reflections of your
   thoughts.
1. (p. 93) Our thoughts change our feelings. Our thoughts do not
   change our instincts.
1. (p. 103) Self-sabotage is just a product of low emotional
   intelligence.
1. (p. 104) **Emotional intelligence** is the ability to interpret the
   sensations that come up in your body and understand what they are
   trying to tell you about your life.
1. (p. 105) Neurologically, when we get something we really want, we
   just start to want more.
1. (p. 105) **Dopamine** is the chemical that gives you the pleasure
   of wanting more.
1. (p. 108) When we are so deeply enmeshed in the feeling of
   "wanting," it becomes hard to adjust to the experience of "having."
1. (p. 108) :star: Any change, no matter how positive, is
   uncomfortable until it is also familiar.
1. (p. 111) It's not radical moments of action that give us
   long-lasting, permeating change -- it's the restructuring of our
   habits.
1. (p. 112) The outcomes of life are not governed by passion, they are
   governed by principle. We control our actions, but the consequences
   that flow from those actions are controlled by principles.
1. (p. 115) Those who can't help but create problems in their minds
   often do so because they have ceased creative control of their
   existence. They think that life happens to them, rather than being
   the product of their actions.
1. (p. 115) Adversity makes you creative.
1. (p. 117) The expectation that a positive event will eliminate all
   stress and bring unprecedented happiness is a destructive one,
   because the event rarely does that (e.g. weddings, childbirth, pay
   raise, new job, etc.)
1. (p. 119) Big achievements actually pressure us to become
   increasingly better versions of ourselves. They are a not positive
   for our lives, but can be just as uncomfortable as struggling was,
   if not more.
1. (p. 120) **Psychic thinking** is assuming you know what somebody
   else is thinking or what they intend to do.
1. (p. 121) Psychic thinking detaches us from reality. It is biased
   toward what we want to believe.
1. (p. 121) Instead of feeling like we are having a down day, psychic
   thinking makes us assume we are having a terrible life.
1. (p. 123) :star: "This moment is not my life. It is a moment *in* my
   life."
1. (p. 126) :star: When you experience a **logical lapse**, the climax
   of your story-telling becomes the conclusion.
1. (p. 127) **Mental strength** is believing that we have the capacity
   to handle things going wrong.
1. (p. 129) When you're very anxious, your brain is taking an often
   innocuous stimulus and extracting some kind of meaning or
   prediction from it.
1. (p. 130) The more you avoid a fear, the more intense it becomes.
1. (p. 130) **Faulty inference**: When you come up with a false
   conclusion based on valid evidence.
1. (p. 132) Crisis is *not* necessary for an artist to function.
1. (p. 141) Just because an experience has ended doesn't mean it's
   over.
1. (p. 142) :star: Instead of accepting the ways we think life did not
   work out, we have to be able to see what was at the core of our
   desire and figure out a way to still give ourselves that experience
   now.
1. (p. 145) A mind stuck in the past doesn't want to return there. It
   was impacted more deeply than you realized and the aftershocks are
   still rippling through you.
1. (p. 147) You can't wait for everything to be perfect to be happy.
   You change your life when you start showing up exactly as you are.
1. (p. 150) Nature depends on imperfection.
1. (p. 151) When something is right for you, it brings you clarity.
   When something is wrong for you, it brings you confusion.
1. (p. 152) You can fall in love with potential and confuse it with
   reality.
1. (p. 153) What is not right for you does not remain with you because
   you don't want it, and so you don't choose it.
1. (p. 154) **Trauma** is what happens when something scares you and
   you do not get over that fear. Trauma is the experience if
   disconnecting with a fundamental source of safety.
1. (p. 179) Trauma happens most severely when our attachment to our
   primary caretakers is compromised.
1. (p. 156) Recovery comes down to restoring the feeling of one's
   safety.
1. (p. 157) You must reestablish a feeling of safety in the exact area
   of life that traumatized you.
1. (p. 161) Stop meditating to feel calm; start meditation to just
   *feel*.
1. (p. 162) Use **breath scans** to find residual tension in the body.
   Breathe in and out slowly, and without taking a break between
   breaths.
1. (p. 165) **Positive disintegration** is when we must adapt our
   self-concept to become someone who can handle, if not thrive, in
   the situation we are in.
1. (p. 168)
    - Fear is not going to protect you. Action is.
    - Worrying is not going to protect you. Preparing is.
    - Overthinking is not going to protect you. Understanding is.
1. (p. 170) People who have truly transformed are not concerned solely
   with how things appear. Their lives are now focused intently on how
   things feel.
1. (p. 170) Prioritize your heart over someone else's eyes.
1. (p. 172) :star: You have nobody to prove wrong but yourself.
1. (p. 180,212) The point of meditation is to make yourself quiet
   enough so that the lake in you comes back to its natural stillness.
   We can use the ripples at the top of the water to trace back down
   to the problem at the bottom.
1. (p. 188) :star: Validating feelings means you remind someone that
   it is human to feel things they don't always understand. Instead of
   trying to strategize, just say, "that must really suck."
1. (p. 190) When someone is complaining about something simple -- and
   they seem to be doing it more than the situation calls for -- they
   aren't trying to get your help about a small issue. They are trying
   to have their feelings validated.
1. (p. 191) Validating your feelings is just letting yourself have
   them.
1. (p. 203) Your purpose doesn't require you to be the best at
   something. It is the things that naturally call you, that
   effortlessly flow out of you, and that evoke specific emotions from
   you.
1. (p. 209) In the healing process, suppressing and controlling can
   seem like a fine line. Suppressing is unconscious. Controlling is
   conscious.
1. (p. 212) Behind the goal of happiness is a lingering sense of
   unhappiness. That's how balance and duality works. Inner peace is
   the state between the scales.

   our feelings. The combination of the two makes the situation feel
   real.
1. (p. 215) Our thoughts are not always reflective of reality and
   should be used as more of suggestions than anything else.
1. (p. 217) Your happiness has never come from things being perfect on
   the outside, but from you being present and open and connected to
   yourself and to the moment.
1. (p. 220) :star: When you are consistently worrying and overthinking, it's
   because you don't have a plan regarding the thing that's making you
   scared.
1. (p. 227) Talk it out, because things are often more complicated in
   your head.
1. (p. 230) When you're struggling, the most insulting and difficult
   thing that someone can tell you is to "just relax," or "just enjoy
   yourself."
1. (p. 230) Ironically, many people who struggle emotionally are, at
   their core, people who actually just have a greater desire to enjoy
   life.
1. (p. 231) Happiness is your natural state. You will return to it on
   your own if you allow the other feelings to come up, be felt and
   processed, and not resisted.
1. (p. 232) :star: :star: Connecting with others is not just spending time with
   them; it has to do with not trying to dominate, impress, or create
   an emotional reaction in someone.
1. (p. 234) Think of life as something you can constantly learn from.
1. (p. 235) Genuinely happy people are more at peace than they are
   ecstatic about everything they experience.
1. (p. 239) One day, the mountain that was in front of you will be so
   far behind you, it will barely be visible in the distance. But who
   you will become in learning to climb it will stay with you forever.
