üëç - I think this book greatly summarizes about 5 of the reads I read so far. It's like "Mastery", "So Good, They Can't Ignore You", "Unlearn", "Psycho-Cybernetics", all rolled up into one. An easy recommend for someone interest in self-help.


Read [the notes I took](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cL6aNnbKgfyrlfOz_jbn4osm2VUX8Tki/view?usp=drive_link) from this book.
