This is a poetic management book that looks a how nature self-organizes and how we can use this force in our organizations. It is a nice blend of highly metaphysical and strangely actionable ideas. I'm sure it took courage to publish a book like this. It made me think a lot about the game of Go and the book _Reinventing Organizations_ (#37).

# :star: Star quotes

1. (p. 13) There are no "windows of opportunity," narrow openings in the
   fabric of space-time that soon disappear forever. Possibilities are
   infinite.
1. (p. 42) Life creates niches not to dominate, but to support.
   Symbiosis is the most favored path for evolution. Niches are an
   example of symbiosis.
1. (p. 50) We encourage others to change only if we honor who they are
   now. We ourselves engage in change only as we discover that we might
   be more of who we are by becoming something different.
1. (p. 51) There are no separated individuals. [We are all connected.]
1. (p. 62) Love is saying yes to belonging.
1. (p. 63) What about those of us marooned in organizations of no
   belonging? Daily, we offer less and less. We withdraw our love and
   give it willingly to other areas of our lives.
1. (p. 82) When we shrink people's access to information, we shrink
   their capacity. They will still self-organize, but why make this
   process difficult? Why starve people who want to create organization?
1. (p. 91) Could we take what feels like a threat and alter its role in
   our lives?
