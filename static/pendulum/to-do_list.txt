NEEDS MORE WORK:--------
Add Slider that determines number of magnets in the field
Unify the Start and Pause/Resume buttons
Add a button that adds a second pendulum (pendulums don't interact with each other), see effect of chaos theory
Allow to remove magnets
Make magnet movement and polarity double-click compatible with mobile
Make drawing trace only happen when start button is pressed (right now, can draw by dragging pendulum). We have to find cause of weird glitch that prevents drawing the trace when we make drawing trace only happen after start button is pressed (remember the hackathon?)
2 canvases for things that move and don't move (don't redraw everything)
