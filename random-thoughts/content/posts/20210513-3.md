... The ex-lover of my aunt is making me laugh by doing the fish-face when I was 3 years old. I unwrap two electronic toy cars: a blue Dodge Viper and a red Jeep Cherokee. The candles in front of me emit smoke from their darkened wick.

I am 3 years old.

This is not my first random thought, but it is the furthest one I can distinctly remember.
