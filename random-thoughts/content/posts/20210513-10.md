Well, turns out this theme doesn't play nice when too many posts are present. Every time I add a post,
more buttons stupidly get crammed in the menu for a result that simply looks ridiculous. Thus, what we had tonight was a fun experiment, but I
think this this template cannot work in the long term.

(I just had a scary thought: if this website looks bad on a 16:9 monitor, I'm not sure I want to know how it
looks like on mobile!)

Oh well, I suppose we'll just leave it for now!

... _Or should we rather go deeper?_
