Well, turns out this theme doesn't play nice when too many posts are present. Every time I add a post, it
stretches the page and makes it look simply ridiculous. Thus, what we had tonight was a fun experiment, but I
think this cannot work in this current stage. Oh well, I suppose we'll just leave it for now!

Or should we rather go deeper?
